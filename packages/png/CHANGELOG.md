### Minor Changes

- faec91c: The difference mask is computed on the review page, not uploaded

  A mask is new bytes by definition whenever anything moved, so it is the one image
  content addressing can never deduplicate: `before` is always a hit and an
  unchanged `after` is a second copy of a baseline, but a mask matches nothing and
  never will. `variance push` now leaves it at home. The review surface holds both
  captures and makes its own when a reviewer opens the difference — through the
  same function, at the same policy, so the two cannot disagree about a threshold,
  an anti-aliasing rule, or what a grown capture does to the union box. Builds
  pushed by earlier versions kept a mask and are still served it.

  Runs are unchanged: the report still writes a diff PNG, because that is the
  picture a developer opens without a deployment, and a deployment is optional.

  `@variance-authority/png` gains a `./mask` subpath — the padding rule and the
  difference, over pixels somebody else decoded — so a caller holding RGBA reaches
  the arithmetic without a codec, and a bundler following it finds no `pngjs`.

### Patch Changes

- e546e21: A subject with no pixels is a baseline without an image, not a subject that got away

  A wrapper whose only child went to a portal, or a conformance mount with no
  children, occupies nothing. Refusing to photograph it is right; refusing the
  subject was not. On Material UI's unit tier that was 1109 of 4371 subjects
  reported as unobserved while the capture held their markup, their rules, their
  component hashes and their accessibility tree — none of which was in doubt.

  `Raster` makes the image optional: `bytes`, `width` and `height` are absent
  together or present together, and `pictured` is the one place that narrows all
  three. Absent means *this subject has no pixels*, which is a measurement — it
  never means the image was lost. `occupiesPixels` asks the same question of a
  record read without bytes, which is the only form a sidecar takes. `observe`
  gets a second tier in `unpictured.ts`, where the comparison such a subject can
  still take — document digest, component hashes, accessibility — is the whole
  verdict. `promotionOf` promotes the sidecar alone when there is no `after`,
  because the subject reached a verdict and the only missing half is the one a
  camera would have produced.

  The file-backed store carries the same nullable pair, and with it the split of a
  baseline's two halves into two path prefixes. `identities` scans the record root,
  because a subject with no pixels has no image directory to be found in and the
  sibling scan would otherwise call another machine's baseline new.

  Capture stops handing this to Playwright to fail on. Both screenshot paths used
  to refuse a zero-area subject in terms of their own arguments — the clip path
  with `Expected options.clip.height to be greater than 0`, the element path by
  spending the full actionability timeout and then complaining about visibility —
  so a reader had a component that rendered nothing and a sentence about a
  rectangle. `captureSubject` decides it now, and the renderer names the subject.

  **Operators:** this is schema **18**. `baselines` and `render_cache` drop
  `NOT NULL` from `width` and `height`, shipped as `0016_pixel-less-baselines.sql`.
  Apply it before pointing a CLI of this version at the deployment; `GET /version`
  reports the schema a build expects.
