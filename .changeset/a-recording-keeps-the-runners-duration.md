A test-selection recording keeps each test file's and each test case's duration as its runner reported it

The coverage file gains a `tests.duration` column: the whole milliseconds Vitest, Jest or Rstest reported for the file, or the `duration` you pass to `startRecording().finish()`. The case index gains the same column for each case: Vitest's task result, Jest's assertion result, Rstest's test result, or the `duration` of a case in the `cases` you pass to `finish()`. A file or case the runner reported nothing for has no duration, never zero, and recordings written before this open with every duration absent.

`variance ask slowest-tests` (`docs_slowest_tests`) lists the files, then the cases, the latest recorded run spent longest in. `--from <path>[,...]` keeps the tests declared under those paths, `--to <path>[,...]` keeps the tests the recording says entered code in them, and the two combine; counts are within that scope, a `to` path the recording has no row for is named as unrecorded, and a path in neither the recording nor the checkout is refused with the nearest recorded path. `recordedDurations` and `recordedPaths` in `@variance-authority/sense` are the reading behind it. `didYouMean` and `nearest` move to `@variance-authority/mcp/tools`, so both binaries suggest a name the same way.
