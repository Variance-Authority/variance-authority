### Patch Changes

- 8dbc834: The components a module declares are read from its code. A declaration written
  in a block comment, a JSDoc example or a template literal no longer names a
  component, so a commented-out `function Retired()` no longer makes its file
  the one that declares `Retired`. A name is declared by a statement of the
  module itself: a function, class or binding inside a function body belongs to
  that function and no longer counts. An `export async function Page()`, an
  abstract class, a generator, a second name in `const A = 1, B = 2`, and a name
  that starts with a non-ASCII capital or carries a `$` are now declared too.

  `variance run`, `variance collect`, the Storybook collector and the route
  collector resolve a component to its `file:line` from the same reading, through
  `indexDeclarations`, which `sense` now exports. What that changes in the index
  they build from `source.dirs`:

  - The line is the first line of the declaring statement. A decorated class
    sits at its first decorator, or at its `export` when the decorator is written
    above the `export`, and a second name in a multi-line `const` at the line of
    the `const`.
  - `.d.ts` files, and test, spec and story files your own `exclude` lets
    through, declare nothing.
  - A file the parser cannot read declares nothing, where the text scan found
    the components in it. That covers a Flow-annotated `.js` file, and a `.vue`,
    `.svelte` or `.mdx` file you add to a collector's `extensions`, which is
    parsed as TSX and fails. The index built from `source.dirs` or a collector's
    `source` does not say so: the file's components are missing, and nothing
    names the file. Only `sense`'s source index, for a file it records, names the
    parse error in that file's record.
  - Building the index needs `sense`'s native addon, which ships for macOS on
    arm64, Linux on x64 and arm64 with glibc, and Windows on x64. On any other
    machine, including an Intel Mac, an Alpine image and Windows on arm64, a
    configured `source.dirs` fails at its first file and names why the addon did
    not load, where the text scan ran anywhere. The route collector depends on
    `sense` for it.

  `indexSource` is removed from `@variance-authority/core/attribute`. Build a
  `SourceIndex` with `indexDeclarations` from `@variance-authority/sense`, or
  write one as plain data: a map from component name to `{ file, line, via }`.
  `SourceRef['via']` loses `'declared'`, which nothing produced, and
  `readCapture` in `@variance-authority/unit-test` refuses a capture whose source
  index carries it.

  The source index format moves to version 18, so an index written before this
  release is rebuilt once instead of keeping the names it read from comments.
- ef496ad: READMEs name what the program does

  The package READMEs, and the `@variance-authority/vantage` and
  `@variance-authority/playwright-test` descriptions, no longer write a test, a
  record or a run as something that says, asks or knows. Each sentence names what
  the program does: a command prints, a record holds a field, a test runs or
  covers. Where a value is filled in from configuration or a default rather than
  recorded, the README says so. Four renamed headings change their anchors:
  `help`'s "Where the declaration is undocumented", `playwright`'s "Where a
  component is declared, read from the engine", `storybook`'s "What a pass sends
  the preview" and `sense`'s "Correct what a file's text declares it imports".

### Minor Changes

- fc59417: A subject id is what you type back, not what the build wrote

  Discovering routes from a directory of files gave `cart/empty.html` the id
  `cart/empty.html`, while the `index.html` beside it became `cart/`. A subject id
  is the name an operator types at `--subjects` and `variance accept`; carrying a
  file extension on one sibling and not the one next to it is a difference nobody
  asked for, and it made the ids depend on how the build chose to write the page
  rather than on which page it is.

  `.html` is now dropped from the id. The URL keeps it — that is what the server is
  actually asked for — and only the id changes. The root `index.html` still takes
  the id `/`.

  **Ids that move are baselines that no longer match.** A subject discovered this
  way under a previous version was stored under its `.html` id and will report
  `new` against the id without it. Accept the ids you meant and it stops happening;
  nothing is compared wrongly in the meantime, because an id with no baseline has
  never been a diff.

  **Two files that would answer to one id are now refused by name.**
  `cart/empty.html` and `cart/empty/index.html` both reduce to `cart/empty`, and
  whichever sorted last silently owned the baseline — the collector watched one page
  and reported the other. It exits `2` naming both files, and asks you to rename one
  or list the routes explicitly.
