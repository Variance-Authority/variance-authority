### Patch Changes

- 8e2a8e5: One connection answers about the run and about the code

  `variance serve` served the report tools and nothing else. An agent in a
  workspace that already had the CLI still had to configure
  `variance-authority-help` as a second MCP server to ask what a package
  publishes or where a name is declared — and that second server was the only
  place a start point could be said at all, because `serve` passed no checkout
  root, so `from` and `to` were refused over the transport the workspace was
  already using. The six source questions had been on `variance ask` since the
  fold began; the fold stopped at the shell.

  Both tool sets now mount over one composite subject, so `tools/list` on
  `variance serve` returns the twelve questions about the run and the six about
  the source, and the six read the checkout the server was started in. Which
  half is read is decided by the question: a report is a file and is re-read on
  every request, a workspace reading is a scan and happens only when one of the
  six is what was asked, so a connection that never asks about the source never
  pays for one.

  Two options on `serve` in `@variance-authority/mcp` carry that, and are useful
  to anyone hosting these tools over more than one subject. `subject` is now
  handed the name of the tool a request calls, where it calls one, so a host can
  read only the half the question needs. `remember` says what is worth keeping
  for the next request, in place of the default structured clone of the whole
  subject: the one tool that compares this request with the last one compares
  reports, and cloning a whole workspace reading on every successful call would
  buy that comparison nothing.

  `@variance-authority/help` is unchanged as a package. What changed is what its
  pages say: a workspace that has the CLI needs nothing from it over either
  transport, and the standalone binary is for the workspace that runs no visual
  suite.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- Say who expands the query

  `variance_locate` and `docs_search` match the words they are given and expand
  nothing: no thesaurus, no stemming past a trailing plural, no model. That was
  true before and said only in the source, so an agent holding `auth` against a
  repository that writes `CredentialGate` read a miss as an absence rather than as
  a wrong vocabulary, and asked the same question again in longer words.

  Both tools now say it in the description the caller reads, and both skills say what
  to do instead: ask again in a different kind of name — what the screen says, what a
  component is likely called, the file it is likely declared in — rather than a
  reworded description of the same thing. The caller holds the ticket and the
  codebase the word came from, which is the context a shipped synonym table would
  be guessing at.
