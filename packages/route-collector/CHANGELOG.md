### Minor Changes

- dc7bb11: A route's components are read after React has hydrated it, and a route read before says so

  The route collector waited for hydration by watching the number of nodes
  carrying a fiber until it held still. A shell that suspends during hydration,
  on a promise read outside any `<Suspense>`, leaves fibers on the nodes rendered
  before it while the root is still uncommitted, so the wait ended there and the
  nodes past it came back with no component. On a loaded machine hydration
  finishes later, and a changed region named no component on one run and its
  component on the next.

  `awaitHydration` now reads React's record of each root on, above (up to the
  `Document`, for an app that hydrates the whole page), under and behind the
  subject, and waits until every one has committed. It returns `state`:
  `hydrated`, `hydrating` or `unrooted`, with `roots`, `pending` and `waitedMs`;
  `hydrated: boolean`, `fibers` and the `confirmations` option are gone.

  A route that stops hydrating with roots uncommitted is refused with their
  number, as a route still showing a Suspense fallback is:
  an effect that runs after hydration can paint a different image. A route with
  no React root is collected with a `react-root-absent` warning, so a region with
  no component says why. A run with `wiring: false` waits for nothing and says
  nothing.

  `resolveProvenance`, `wiringOf`, `holdingOf` and `componentFiberOf` read
  nothing off a node whose root has not committed. `resolveProvenance` returns
  the new `UNCOMMITTED` sentinel, reason `'uncommitted'`, for it, where it used to
  resolve the component of a render React had not committed. A root that
  committed `null` now reads as committed. An Eyes archive accepts a target
  recorded with that reason.
- 0d280fc: A route waits for hydration only while something can still finish it, and says when hydration changed it

  No clock decides how long a route waits for React to hydrate it: the route
  collector's `hydrationTimeoutMs` option and its two-second default are gone. React's own record decides: the collector
  waits while a root has a render React can do or a commit has effects React has
  not run, and, while React is stuck on a promise or has no root yet, for as long
  as anything the page requested is still arriving. A route React stops
  hydrating with nothing left arriving is refused at once, and the refusal says
  React had no work it could do and nothing was arriving to give it some. A slow
  route is waited for however long its responses take; a route held on a timer
  or on a promise nothing settles is refused without waiting.

  A route React never loaded on is read once no script it requested is still
  arriving, because only a script brings a renderer, so a long poll on such a page
  holds nothing: the route agent taps React's commits from before the page's first
  script, so it knows no React came, and its `react-root-absent` warning says
  React had not loaded and suggests `wiring: false`.

  A route that hydrates is now compared. The commit tap copies the markup in
  React's hydration commit, inert, and it is compared with the markup once React
  has nothing left to do, so a fast machine and a slow one give the same answer.
  A difference is reported as a `hydration-changed-markup` warning that quotes
  the markup at the hydration commit and the client's around the change, and
  names the components that committed after hydrating in the roots that reach
  the subject. The route is
  still read as it ended.

  `awaitHydration` takes `tap`, a `tapCommits` tap, and `outstanding(of)`, a
  function that resolves `true` once something the page requested has arrived and
  `false` when nothing is in flight. `of` is an `AwaitedArrival`: `'script'` when
  the tap saw no React load, so only scripts count, and `'any'` otherwise; without it, a root stuck on a promise is returned as
  `hydrating` at once. Its `timeoutMs` option is gone. Its settlement carries
  `loaded: false` when the tap saw no React load, and `changed`, a
  `MarkupChange`, when the markup moved. A `tapCommits` tap gains
  `effectsPending(root?)`, true while a commit's passive effects have not run on
  that root, or on any without one, and `hydration(root)`, a `RootHydration`: the
  markup copied at that root's hydration commit and the commits since. The tap
  reads React 18's passive-effect flags as React 18 sets them, so a React 18 root
  is no longer held busy by flags React 18 never clears. `detectReactVersion`
  reads the hook through the same reader as the tap.

  `watchArrivals(page)`, exported by the Playwright package, answers
  `outstanding` from the page's own requests, leaving out event streams,
  WebSockets and media, which are open by design, and fonts and images, which
  React waits on neither and the asset stages wait for and name. The Playwright harness installs
  it, and its page agent by init script before the first navigation, so the first
  document gets the agent ahead of its own scripts, as every later one already
  did. A page agent that fails while a request is still arriving fails naming
  that request, with Playwright's error as the cause.
- 8605b15: A page can leave a route run by saying so

  A sitemap lists pages you do not review as pixels, such as long articles that
  change with every prose edit. Put `data-variance-exclude="<reason>"` on any
  element of such a page, or on the layout every article shares, and the route
  collector navigates to it, reads and photographs nothing, and the run lists it
  as `excluded` with that reason. An excluded page never sends a run to review.
  A collector answers this with `{ ok: false, excluded: true, because }`.
- e6afc58: A page run records what each page ran and showed

  `routeCollector({ tests })` records, for every page, the code its browser ran,
  the code each server named in `heads` rendered for it under a journey of its
  own, and the files its root names in `data-variance-reads`. A later
  `variance run --since <ref> --suite <name>` photographs only the pages that ran
  a changed line or showed a changed file.

  `@variance-authority/reads` is the attribute's production half: `reads(path)`
  returns the props that name the files an element showed. It has no
  dependencies and no runtime.
- bd4243a: An image, font or media request still unanswered when the network wait runs
  out refuses the subject, naming the URL. The subject used to be read without
  it, with a `network-not-quiet` warning. `NetworkObservation.settle()` now
  resolves that refusal, or `undefined` once nothing is in flight; a caller that
  ignores it reads a subject whose bytes nobody hashed.
  Only the requests a subject started count against it: one still open from an
  earlier subject on the same page was named in that subject's refusal.
  One the read itself asks for and never gets makes `acquireFromAgent` throw
  `UnansweredAssets`, which both collectors turn into that subject's refusal.
- 9bcb49c: A sitemap's pages are visited on the server the sitemap was read from. A site writes its sitemap for where it is published, so `sitemap: 'http://localhost:8787/sitemap.xml'` used to photograph production; each entry now keeps its path and query and takes the sitemap's origin. `routesFrom(xml, sitemap)` takes the sitemap's URL for the same reason.
- 6a48740: The site root, `/`, is filed as `index`. Its id has no segment to name a baseline file after, so the default `baselines.path` refused it with "has no letter or digit in its {name}", and a sitemap or built directory with a home page could not be run. The id stays `/`, which is what `--subjects` and `variance accept` take.

  With `widths` declared, the root was filed by its width alone, as `1280-chromium.png`, and is now `index-1280-chromium.png`. The next run reports the root as `new` and names the old file as a baseline the plan no longer holds: accept the new one and delete the old. A sitemap listing both `/` and `/index` now places both at one path, and the run refuses it by name.

### Patch Changes

- 8d1bcc1: A link in a doc comment opens from `node_modules`

  Doc comments linked to documentation by repository paths such as
  `../../../../docs/flakiness.md`, which resolve to nothing in an installed
  package. They now link to the page on variance-authority.dev, or to the file on
  GitHub when the site does not publish it, so the link works on hover in your
  editor and in what `variance ask symbol` prints.

  The MCP server's instructions and its observability answer linked to
  `/start-cli` and `/presentation`, which the site does not serve. They now link
  to `/start/cli` and `/docs/presentation`, and the `@variance-authority/cli`,
  `@variance-authority/help`, `@variance-authority/mcp` and
  `@variance-authority/vitest-browser` READMEs link to the guides where the site
  publishes them.

  `variancePrecondition`, `wiringOf`, `tapCommits` and `provenanceOf` carry an
  `@see` link to the section of the guide that documents them.
- 18c70d3: A run collects in parallel by default, and the report says where each subject's time went

  Without `workers` in the config, a run collected in one browser world, so a
  route suite read its pages one after another on any machine. It now collects in
  half the machine's logical cores, at least one and never more worlds than there
  are files: two on a 4-vCPU CI runner, eight on a 16-core laptop. A `concurrency`
  you set holds it lower, since every world keeps a page and a subject in flight.
  A `workers` you set still wins over both. Set `workers: 1` for a server under
  test that cannot take concurrent pages. A collector with no `openWorker` still
  collects in one world, and the run warns about it only when you set `workers`. Verdicts and the order
  of observations do not depend on the count, and the report's new `workers` field
  records it. `variance collect` takes the same width.

  A changed subject read in a second world is now run alone like one read in the
  first. A worker opens no clean world of its own, so the run asked the worker and
  reported "not re-run alone: collector has no `collectAlone`"; it now asks the
  collector that can open one.

  The `alone.limit` budget now goes to the first subjects to change in the order
  the run takes them. It went to whichever changed subjects reached it first, so
  with more changed subjects than the limit, which ones carried `again` and
  `alone` evidence depended on the number of worlds and on timing.

  Each observation in the report also carries `steps` beside `costMs`: every
  phase the subject went through, in the order it ran, with its wall time. The
  collector's phases are named `collect.*` (`collect.navigate`,
  `collect.wait-for-fonts`, `collect.capture`), the run's own are `compose`,
  `inspect`, `settle`, `baseline`, `cache.get`, `cache.put`, `decode`, `compare`,
  `write`, `again.collect` and `alone.collect`, and a painted subject adds the
  renderer's under `render.*`. The report's `steps` sums each phase over the
  subjects that ran it and counts them. A phase a subject skipped is absent, not
  zero. Timings are part of no digest, so images, records and baselines do not
  move when only timing does.

  `settleRecipe`, `stabilizeForObservation`, `compareRasters` and the raster
  `Renderer.render` take an optional step clock and report the steps they ran on
  it. The route page agent and `readRoute` always return the steps they took.
  `stepClock`, `timeOn` and `totalsOf` are exported from
  `@variance-authority/core/format`.

  A run that is not sharded now reads the mainline's subject costs at every
  width, as a sharded run always did, and takes its slowest files first. One
  world takes its subjects in the same order as several, so the budget above
  reaches the same subjects.

  `concurrency` is split evenly across the worlds and rounded up, at least one
  per world, so by default the raster tier is as wide as the number of worlds.

  The frame above a subject carries its classes in code-unit order. Storybook
  swaps its layout class on a page it reuses, so their order said which story the
  page showed before, and a run in parallel lanes gave the same story a different
  document, and a render-cache miss, with the same pixels.
- c3c8e61: An absolute `source.dirs` entry is walked

  Both collectors joined every `source.dirs` entry onto the working directory, so
  an absolute path such as `/repo/packages/ui/src` was looked for under that
  directory, matched nothing, and the run was refused for having no source files.
  An absolute entry is now walked as written, and a relative one is still resolved
  against the working directory. File names in the index stay relative to that
  directory either way. When no entry matches any file, the refusal lists each
  directory by the absolute path it walked, in place of the entries as spelled
  followed by `(from <root>)`.
- 52d87e4: A run starts one Chromium. Harnesses and the renderer lease one browser per launch recipe and the last to close it closes it, so a Storybook or route run with four workers launches one browser instead of five. A Storybook run's workers also share one browser context, and with it the HTTP cache: a worker's preview boots from what the first page fetched instead of downloading the bundle again (at four workers on the storybook case, 75 fetches and 29 MB became 17 fetches and 6 MB).

  New options: `createHarness({ warm })` opens the page in a context shared with other warm harnesses, `createHarness({ isolated })` launches a browser of the harness's own, and `observeNetwork(page, { cache })` watches the wire through the DevTools protocol with the HTTP cache left on (Chromium only). The `alone` reading in both collectors stays in a browser of its own.

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- 1a0b845: A subject is read with nothing hovered, nothing focused, motion reduced and `Date` fixed

  Every layout and raster baseline made before this release is compared under a
  moved recipe once; a semantic baseline, read in jsdom, does not move. The
  default recipes gained tricks, so the stabilization digest every reading records
  has changed, and each subject names that recipe as the cause of whatever it
  reports. Review the changes and adopt them with `variance accept --all`, as for
  any recipe change.

  The standard collection recipe now also holds:

  - `no-hover`: the pointer is moved to `(-1, -1)`, off the page, once per page
    before it loads. On the `variance` fixture's page it is moved again before
    every observation, a frame each, and not put back: a menu a script opened on
    hover is closed for your test's next step.
  - `no-focus`: whatever holds focus is blurred before the subject is read,
    including an element inside a shadow root. On a page your test or agent goes
    on using, focus goes back to that element once the reading and any screenshot
    of it are taken, so a test types where it left off. The blur still ran the
    page's blur handlers, and what they did, such as a validate-on-blur error,
    stays.
  - `reduced-motion`: the browser reports `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`, which
    stops the script animations of a page that honours it, and the reading
    declares the same preference among the conditions its `@media` rules are
    resolved against. A `prefers-reduced-motion` condition you declare through
    `createHarness`'s `features` wins, and the browser is asked for that value;
    a declared `no-preference` is not recorded as `reduced-motion`. Rules under
    `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)` are not read by default;
    leave `reduced-motion` out to read them.
  - `freeze-clock`: `Date` reads one instant. A script added before the page's
    own replaces `new Date()`, `Date()` and `Date.now()`, and gives the same
    instant to `Intl.DateTimeFormat`'s `format()` and `formatToParts()` called
    without a date. Timers, animation frames and `performance.now()` are the
    browser's own, so a page that settles on a timer still settles. No Playwright
    clock is installed, so `page.clock` stays yours, and a clock your test
    installs replaces the fixed `Date`; the reading still records `freeze-clock`,
    so leave it out of the list when your test owns the clock. `Temporal.Now` and
    `Date` inside a worker are not fixed. The default instant is in the past, and
    the browser's cookie store keeps real time: a cookie your page's script sets
    with an expiry counted from `Date.now()` is already expired and is not
    stored, so a dismissed consent banner can come back after the next
    navigation. Set `varianceNow` or `now` near today, or leave `freeze-clock`
    out.

  The render and layout recipes gain `no-focus` alone, because a painted document
  still honours a collected `autofocus`. The other three have nothing to act on
  there: the date the page printed is already text in the document, and its
  `@media` rules were resolved when it was read. A `<script>` inside a subject
  root is carried into the render document and runs there under the real clock.
  Every document is painted under the render recipe, so a reading taken without
  `no-focus` is still painted blurred.

  The instant defaults to `DEFAULT_NOW`, `2024-06-15T12:00:00.000Z`, exported
  from `@variance-authority/core/format`. `routeCollector` and
  `storybookCollector` take a `now` option to choose another. It must be an ISO
  8601 instant with its zone; anything else is refused before a browser opens.
  An instant other than the default is spelled in the clock's id,
  `freeze-clock@<instant>`, so it is part of the environment key, and a baseline taken at one instant is compared
  with a run at another with the moved instant named as the cause.

  To read a subject hovered, focused, animated or at the real time, pass your own
  `stabilize` list without that trick: `DEFAULT_STABILIZE`, the ids of the
  default recipe, filtered, as in
  `DEFAULT_STABILIZE.filter((id) => id !== 'freeze-clock')`. It is exported from
  `@variance-authority/core/format`, `@variance-authority/route-collector`,
  `@variance-authority/storybook-collector` and
  `@variance-authority/playwright-test`. `storybookCollector` and `observe` in
  `@variance-authority/playwright-test` now take `stabilize`, as `routeCollector`
  already did.

  A trick needs a browser driver to apply it, and is recorded only where one did.
  The collectors apply all four. So does the `variance` fixture in
  `@variance-authority/playwright-test`: it sets `reduced-motion` and
  `freeze-clock` on the `page` it hands your test, before the test body runs, and
  takes the pointer off the page and releases focus before every observation,
  giving focus back after it. Two new fixture options, `varianceStabilize` and
  `varianceNow`, choose what it sets and the instant, and are set with
  `test.use`; `varianceDriven` holds the ids it set. A fixed `Date` stops code
  that times itself with `Date.now()`: a debounce or a throttle, such as lodash's
  `debounce`, sees no time pass and never fires, so a test that types into a
  debounced search box can stop getting results after this upgrade. A loop that
  waits for `Date.now()` to pass a mark hangs the page, an animation timed by
  `Date`, such as jQuery's `animate`, never calls its `complete`, and a client
  that checks a token's `nbf` or `iat` against `Date.now()` can refuse a token
  issued today. None of these failures names the clock. Leave
  `freeze-clock` out for such a test, and for one that sets `page.clock` itself:

  ```ts
  import { DEFAULT_STABILIZE } from '@variance-authority/playwright-test';

  test.use({ varianceStabilize: DEFAULT_STABILIZE.filter((id) => id !== 'freeze-clock') });
  ```

  On a page the fixture never handed your test,
  such as one opened from your own browser context, call the new
  `driveBeforeTest(page)` before `page.goto()` to set the same two; `observe` and
  `createVariance` there apply `no-hover` and `no-focus`.
  `@variance-authority/vitest-browser` reads from inside your page and has no
  driver; `@variance-authority/presentation` reads through the Playwright `Page`
  you hand it, a test's or an agent's live browser, and does not drive it. Both
  apply `no-focus` only, giving focus back once the reading is taken. A trick left out is absent from the
  reading's ids and digest, as a trick a tier cannot reach already is.
  `stabilizeForObservation` in `@variance-authority/dom` takes `driven`, the ids
  your driver applied, and returns `refocus()`, which gives focus back to the
  element the reading released. `stabilizeAsRequested` takes the recipe by id, as
  a page agent receives it. `createHarness` in `@variance-authority/playwright`
  takes a `stabilize` recipe to drive its page before the first navigation, and
  reports the ids it applied as `driven`. `createObservedHarness` opens one with
  `observeNetwork` started before its first navigation, as both collectors do.

  `createPlaywrightRenderer` no longer couples `no-focus` to `waitForFonts`:
  `waitForFonts: false` turns off the waits alone.

  `@variance-authority/core/format` exports `DEFAULT_STABILIZE`, `DEFAULT_NOW`,
  `driveBeforeLoad` and `driveBeforeRead`, which apply the driver tricks to a
  Playwright `Page`, `forDriver`, which drops the ones a host did not apply,
  `featuresOf`, which declares the motion preference a recipe drove, and
  `recipeToDrive`, which resolves a `stabilize` list and checks `now` before a
  browser opens.
- d432339: A page reads its clock in UTC and formats for en-US, not for the host

  The harness the route and Storybook collectors open, and the pages the renderer
  paints, took their timezone and locale from the machine. A date the page
  formatted read one way on a laptop in Sydney and another on a runner in
  Virginia, from one build, and the two compared against one baseline as
  `changed`.

  Both are pinned: `timezoneId` to `UTC` and `locale` to `en-US`. Declare either
  in `variance.config.json` (`"timezoneId": "Europe/Berlin"`, `"locale":
  "de-DE"`) and the collectors and the renderer pin that instead; an unknown
  timezone or a malformed language tag is refused by its field.
  `createHarness` and `createPlaywrightRenderer` take the same two options.
  `@variance-authority/core/format` exports their type, `PageRegion`, and
  `@variance-authority/playwright` exports `pinnedRegion`, which fills in `UTC`
  and `en-US` for a field left out.

  Both are part of the environment key, and the renderer's pair is part of
  `RenderIdentity.rasterization`. A capture read in another timezone or language
  is another environment, and an image painted in one is compared with a
  baseline painted in another, with `rasterization` named as the cause of
  whatever moved.

  `@variance-authority/playwright-test` paints each test in the timezone and
  locale its page runs in: whatever the Playwright project or `test.use` sets.
  When neither sets a `timezoneId`, `varianceFixtures` opens the page in `UTC`
  rather than the host's, so a laptop and a runner in UTC read it under one key;
  Playwright Test already opens it in `en-US` when nothing sets a `locale`. That
  reaches every test of a suite extended with `varianceFixtures`, including tests
  that never call `variance`, so a test that asserts a date formatted in your
  machine's timezone reads it in `UTC` after this upgrade; set `timezoneId` in
  `use` to keep your own. A page
  you hand to `createVariance` is read and painted in whatever its own context
  opened it in, which is the host's timezone when that context set none: open the
  context with `timezoneId: 'UTC'` to match. `varianceRenderer` is now a test fixture, chosen
  by the page, and `varianceRenderers` is the worker's set of renderers, one per
  timezone and locale; a project that overrode `varianceRenderer` at worker scope
  overrides it at test scope instead.

  **Every image painted by the Playwright renderer is compared under a moved
  recipe once after this upgrade**, because its recipe now carries the timezone
  and locale. Each subject names `rasterization` as the cause of what it reports,
  and one whose pixels moved is `changed`:

  - With `variance run`: the run exits `1` for each `changed` subject. Review
    them in `variance report --format html` and adopt them with
    `variance accept --all`. A rerun reports `unchanged`.
  - With `@variance-authority/playwright-test`: the suite fails each `changed`
    test, and `--update-snapshots=changed` adopts them.
  - With `@variance-authority/vitest-browser`: `vitest --update` adopts them, as
    `variance accept --all` does.

  `@variance-authority/vitest-browser` reads no `variance.config.json` and takes no
  timezone or locale, so it paints in `UTC` and `en-US` whatever its tab ran in,
  and neither it nor `@variance-authority/unit-test` writes a timezone or locale
  to the environment key.
- 754d04c: The port a build is served on is no part of a render

  The route and Storybook collectors serve a build on a free port, and that port
  reached three identities. An asset the page loaded was keyed by its absolute
  URL, a `url()` in a computed style was the absolute URL the engine resolved,
  and the document digest read both. One build served twice therefore read as two
  environment keys and two documents: each run missed the render cache, painted
  again, and read its document as changed against its own baseline.

  An asset the page's own origin serves is keyed by its path, and the page's
  origin is dropped from a `url()` before it is hashed. An asset another origin
  serves keeps its absolute URL. A capture carries the page's `baseUrl` so core
  knows which origin is the page's, and the renderer resolves a path-keyed asset
  against the document's `baseUrl`. `documentDigest` reads the page's own base
  and resources as paths, so one build served on two ports addresses one render
  and the render cache hits; the document keeps them absolute for the renderer,
  and a resource another origin serves stays absolute in the digest too.

  A `@variance-authority/unit-test` capture keys its assets the same way, so a
  `@variance-authority/vitest-browser` observation, which captures through it on
  the port the runner had free, keeps the port out of its environment key.
  `readCapture` reads back a capture whose asset is keyed by path, resolving the
  key against the document's `baseUrl` as the renderer does; `assetUrl` in
  `@variance-authority/core/format` is that one resolution.

  **The document of every page served over `http` moves once after this
  upgrade.** `documentDigest` now reads a document's base and resources without
  the page's origin, so the digest of every document served over `http` or
  `https` changes: every route, every story, every Vitest browser page, and every
  Playwright page opened by URL. A moved document misses the render cache once,
  and its image is still compared with the baseline: a page whose pixels did not
  move reads `unchanged`, and one whose pixels did reads `changed`, which
  `variance accept --all` and Playwright's `--update-snapshots=changed` adopt.
  `RULESET_VERSION` moves from `r1` to `r2`. The ruleset is part of a snapshot's
  environment key, not of the render recipe, so no image names it as a moved
  identity; a snapshot diffed against one recorded under `r1` names the ruleset as its
  environment root.

### Patch Changes

- 8dbc834: The components a module declares are read from its code. A declaration written
  in a block comment, a JSDoc example or a template literal no longer names a
  component, so a commented-out `function Retired()` no longer makes its file
  the one that declares `Retired`. A name is declared by a statement of the
  module itself: a function, class or binding inside a function body belongs to
  that function and no longer counts. An `export async function Page()`, an
  abstract class, a generator, a second name in `const A = 1, B = 2`, and a name
  that starts with a non-ASCII capital or carries a `$` are now declared too.

  `variance run`, `variance collect`, the Storybook collector and the route
  collector resolve a component to its `file:line` from the same reading, through
  `indexDeclarations`, which `sense` now exports. What that changes in the index
  they build from `source.dirs`:

  - The line is the first line of the declaring statement. A decorated class
    sits at its first decorator, or at its `export` when the decorator is written
    above the `export`, and a second name in a multi-line `const` at the line of
    the `const`.
  - `.d.ts` files, and test, spec and story files your own `exclude` lets
    through, declare nothing.
  - A file the parser cannot read declares nothing, where the text scan found
    the components in it. That covers a Flow-annotated `.js` file, and a `.vue`,
    `.svelte` or `.mdx` file you add to a collector's `extensions`, which is
    parsed as TSX and fails. The index built from `source.dirs` or a collector's
    `source` does not say so: the file's components are missing, and nothing
    names the file. Only `sense`'s source index, for a file it records, names the
    parse error in that file's record.
  - Building the index needs `sense`'s native addon, which ships for macOS on
    arm64, Linux on x64 and arm64 with glibc, and Windows on x64. On any other
    machine, including an Intel Mac, an Alpine image and Windows on arm64, a
    configured `source.dirs` fails at its first file and names why the addon did
    not load, where the text scan ran anywhere. The route collector depends on
    `sense` for it.

  `indexSource` is removed from `@variance-authority/core/attribute`. Build a
  `SourceIndex` with `indexDeclarations` from `@variance-authority/sense`, or
  write one as plain data: a map from component name to `{ file, line, via }`.
  `SourceRef['via']` loses `'declared'`, which nothing produced, and
  `readCapture` in `@variance-authority/unit-test` refuses a capture whose source
  index carries it.

  The source index format moves to version 18, so an index written before this
  release is rebuilt once instead of keeping the names it read from comments.
- 1eed290: A form filled in after mount is painted and compared filled in

  Text a play function or a test typed into an `<input>` or `<textarea>`, the
  option it chose in a `<select>` and the box it ticked now reach the render
  document and the snapshot. Before, the document painted the form as the server
  sent it and the snapshot did not move for typed text or a chosen option. A
  password field's value is carried as one `•` per character, and a file input's
  value is not carried. A form nobody filled in reads exactly as before.

  This is part of `RULESET_VERSION` `r2`. A subject whose form was filled in
  after the server sent it has a new render document, so after this upgrade its
  image shows the form filled in and reads `changed` against a baseline painted
  empty; `variance accept --all` adopts it. A Playwright test painted its form
  filled in before this change, so it does not move there.
- ef496ad: READMEs name what the program does

  The package READMEs, and the `@variance-authority/vantage` and
  `@variance-authority/playwright-test` descriptions, no longer write a test, a
  record or a run as something that says, asks or knows. Each sentence names what
  the program does: a command prints, a record holds a field, a test runs or
  covers. Where a value is filled in from configuration or a default rather than
  recorded, the README says so. Four renamed headings change their anchors:
  `help`'s "Where the declaration is undocumented", `playwright`'s "Where a
  component is declared, read from the engine", `storybook`'s "What a pass sends
  the preview" and `sense`'s "Correct what a file's text declares it imports".

### Minor Changes

- fc59417: A subject id is what you type back, not what the build wrote

  Discovering routes from a directory of files gave `cart/empty.html` the id
  `cart/empty.html`, while the `index.html` beside it became `cart/`. A subject id
  is the name an operator types at `--subjects` and `variance accept`; carrying a
  file extension on one sibling and not the one next to it is a difference nobody
  asked for, and it made the ids depend on how the build chose to write the page
  rather than on which page it is.

  `.html` is now dropped from the id. The URL keeps it — that is what the server is
  actually asked for — and only the id changes. The root `index.html` still takes
  the id `/`.

  **Ids that move are baselines that no longer match.** A subject discovered this
  way under a previous version was stored under its `.html` id and will report
  `new` against the id without it. Accept the ids you meant and it stops happening;
  nothing is compared wrongly in the meantime, because an id with no baseline has
  never been a diff.

  **Two files that would answer to one id are now refused by name.**
  `cart/empty.html` and `cart/empty/index.html` both reduce to `cart/empty`, and
  whichever sorted last silently owned the baseline — the collector watched one page
  and reported the other. It exits `2` naming both files, and asks you to rename one
  or list the routes explicitly.
