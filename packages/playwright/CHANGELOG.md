### Minor Changes

- d0993fb: A Chromium shot no longer depends on what the page painted before it

  `CHROMIUM_RASTER_ARGS` adds `--disable-partial-raster`. With partial raster, an
  edit repaints only the damaged part of a tile, and those pixels come out one
  colour level off a whole-tile paint. A page that mounts subject after subject
  could shoot the same subject two ways: a baseline taken after another subject
  differed from the same baseline taken first. Every tile is now painted whole:
  240 mounts and shots on one page took 23.9 ms each with the flag and 24.0 ms
  without it.

  The flag is part of the ordered launch recipe, so a baseline recorded under the
  old recipe comes back as a change caused by `rasterization`, and `accept`
  adopts the new image. If you copy `CHROMIUM_RASTER_ARGS` into your own
  `launchOptions`, the next run reports the same `rasterization` cause. A launch
  list that spells the flags out by hand keeps the old recipe until you add
  `--disable-partial-raster` to it.

- 0d280fc: A route waits for hydration only while something can still finish it, and says when hydration changed it

  No clock decides how long a route waits for React to hydrate it: the route
  collector's `hydrationTimeoutMs` option and its two-second default are gone. React's own record decides: the collector
  waits while a root has a render React can do or a commit has effects React has
  not run, and, while React is stuck on a promise or has no root yet, for as long
  as anything the page requested is still arriving. A route React stops
  hydrating with nothing left arriving is refused at once, and the refusal says
  React had no work it could do and nothing was arriving to give it some. A slow
  route is waited for however long its responses take; a route held on a timer
  or on a promise nothing settles is refused without waiting.

  A route React never loaded on is read once no script it requested is still
  arriving, because only a script brings a renderer, so a long poll on such a page
  holds nothing: the route agent taps React's commits from before the page's first
  script, so it knows no React came, and its `react-root-absent` warning says
  React had not loaded and suggests `wiring: false`.

  A route that hydrates is now compared. The commit tap copies the markup in
  React's hydration commit, inert, and it is compared with the markup once React
  has nothing left to do, so a fast machine and a slow one give the same answer.
  A difference is reported as a `hydration-changed-markup` warning that quotes
  the markup at the hydration commit and the client's around the change, and
  names the components that committed after hydrating in the roots that reach
  the subject. The route is
  still read as it ended.

  `awaitHydration` takes `tap`, a `tapCommits` tap, and `outstanding(of)`, a
  function that resolves `true` once something the page requested has arrived and
  `false` when nothing is in flight. `of` is an `AwaitedArrival`: `'script'` when
  the tap saw no React load, so only scripts count, and `'any'` otherwise; without it, a root stuck on a promise is returned as
  `hydrating` at once. Its `timeoutMs` option is gone. Its settlement carries
  `loaded: false` when the tap saw no React load, and `changed`, a
  `MarkupChange`, when the markup moved. A `tapCommits` tap gains
  `effectsPending(root?)`, true while a commit's passive effects have not run on
  that root, or on any without one, and `hydration(root)`, a `RootHydration`: the
  markup copied at that root's hydration commit and the commits since. The tap
  reads React 18's passive-effect flags as React 18 sets them, so a React 18 root
  is no longer held busy by flags React 18 never clears. `detectReactVersion`
  reads the hook through the same reader as the tap.

  `watchArrivals(page)`, exported by the Playwright package, answers
  `outstanding` from the page's own requests, leaving out event streams,
  WebSockets and media, which are open by design, and fonts and images, which
  React waits on neither and the asset stages wait for and name. The Playwright harness installs
  it, and its page agent by init script before the first navigation, so the first
  document gets the agent ahead of its own scripts, as every later one already
  did. A page agent that fails while a request is still arriving fails naming
  that request, with Playwright's error as the cause.
- b7b793d: A prefetch never leaves the page

  `observeNetwork` refuses a request the page sends on speculation: one marked
  `Sec-Purpose: prefetch` or `Purpose: prefetch`, as `<link rel="prefetch">` and
  speculation rules send it, or `Next-Router-Prefetch: 1`, as the Next.js App
  Router and routers reproducing it send for every link in view. What the page
  guesses it shows next is not what it shows. Served, a prefetch renders another
  page's code under this page's journey, and when it is sent depends on what
  scrolled into view.
- 8605b15: A subject longer than 16,384 device pixels is refused, not photographed

  A subject longer than 16,384 device pixels on either side, Chromium's largest
  texture side, is neither captured nor clipped. The run records it as failed,
  with its size, and names the fix: bound it with tighter roots, or leave the page
  out.
- bd4243a: An image, font or media request still unanswered when the network wait runs
  out refuses the subject, naming the URL. The subject used to be read without
  it, with a `network-not-quiet` warning. `NetworkObservation.settle()` now
  resolves that refusal, or `undefined` once nothing is in flight; a caller that
  ignores it reads a subject whose bytes nobody hashed.
  Only the requests a subject started count against it: one still open from an
  earlier subject on the same page was named in that subject's refusal.
  One the read itself asks for and never gets makes `acquireFromAgent` throw
  `UnansweredAssets`, which both collectors turn into that subject's refusal.
- 52d87e4: A run starts one Chromium. Harnesses and the renderer lease one browser per launch recipe and the last to close it closes it, so a Storybook or route run with four workers launches one browser instead of five. A Storybook run's workers also share one browser context, and with it the HTTP cache: a worker's preview boots from what the first page fetched instead of downloading the bundle again (at four workers on the storybook case, 75 fetches and 29 MB became 17 fetches and 6 MB).

  New options: `createHarness({ warm })` opens the page in a context shared with other warm harnesses, `createHarness({ isolated })` launches a browser of the harness's own, and `observeNetwork(page, { cache })` watches the wire through the DevTools protocol with the HTTP cache left on (Chromium only). The `alone` reading in both collectors stays in a browser of its own.

### Patch Changes

- 18c70d3: A run collects in parallel by default, and the report says where each subject's time went

  Without `workers` in the config, a run collected in one browser world, so a
  route suite read its pages one after another on any machine. It now collects in
  half the machine's logical cores, at least one and never more worlds than there
  are files: two on a 4-vCPU CI runner, eight on a 16-core laptop. A `concurrency`
  you set holds it lower, since every world keeps a page and a subject in flight.
  A `workers` you set still wins over both. Set `workers: 1` for a server under
  test that cannot take concurrent pages. A collector with no `openWorker` still
  collects in one world, and the run warns about it only when you set `workers`. Verdicts and the order
  of observations do not depend on the count, and the report's new `workers` field
  records it. `variance collect` takes the same width.

  A changed subject read in a second world is now run alone like one read in the
  first. A worker opens no clean world of its own, so the run asked the worker and
  reported "not re-run alone: collector has no `collectAlone`"; it now asks the
  collector that can open one.

  The `alone.limit` budget now goes to the first subjects to change in the order
  the run takes them. It went to whichever changed subjects reached it first, so
  with more changed subjects than the limit, which ones carried `again` and
  `alone` evidence depended on the number of worlds and on timing.

  Each observation in the report also carries `steps` beside `costMs`: every
  phase the subject went through, in the order it ran, with its wall time. The
  collector's phases are named `collect.*` (`collect.navigate`,
  `collect.wait-for-fonts`, `collect.capture`), the run's own are `compose`,
  `inspect`, `settle`, `baseline`, `cache.get`, `cache.put`, `decode`, `compare`,
  `write`, `again.collect` and `alone.collect`, and a painted subject adds the
  renderer's under `render.*`. The report's `steps` sums each phase over the
  subjects that ran it and counts them. A phase a subject skipped is absent, not
  zero. Timings are part of no digest, so images, records and baselines do not
  move when only timing does.

  `settleRecipe`, `stabilizeForObservation`, `compareRasters` and the raster
  `Renderer.render` take an optional step clock and report the steps they ran on
  it. The route page agent and `readRoute` always return the steps they took.
  `stepClock`, `timeOn` and `totalsOf` are exported from
  `@variance-authority/core/format`.

  A run that is not sharded now reads the mainline's subject costs at every
  width, as a sharded run always did, and takes its slowest files first. One
  world takes its subjects in the same order as several, so the budget above
  reaches the same subjects.

  `concurrency` is split evenly across the worlds and rounded up, at least one
  per world, so by default the raster tier is as wide as the number of worlds.

  The frame above a subject carries its classes in code-unit order. Storybook
  swaps its layout class on a page it reuses, so their order said which story the
  page showed before, and a run in parallel lanes gave the same story a different
  document, and a render-cache miss, with the same pixels.
- 402ce9f: A story's parameters are read when the story is reached, so no story file is imported before its story comes up

  Your Storybook run used to read every story's `parameters.variance` before the
  first story, through the preview's `extract()`. That imported every story file
  up front: on a large Storybook you paid for the whole build before seeing one
  story, and each file's first story then timed its import as 0 in `collect`.

  The run now plans from `index.json` alone. When it reaches a story, it asks the
  preview for that story's merged parameters, which imports only that story's
  file, the import showing the story would have made anyway. That import is
  charged to the story's `collect`, so the first story of each file carries what
  its file costs. A story that excludes itself is still skipped and listed in the
  report with its reason, and a story whose parameters cannot be read is read at
  your run's `viewport` with a warning naming it. A preview too old to read one
  story's parameters says so once per run, not once per story.

  A story that declares `widths` is still read as `<story id>@<width>` at each
  width, with its own baseline, and all its widths are read on the same page in
  one visit: nothing is opened, booted or loaded again for a second width. A
  run that does not read such a story, because `--subjects`, `--since` or a shard
  left it out, because its visit failed, or because its parameters could not be read, still counts its width baselines as
  planned rather than naming them as baselines your plan no longer holds. A
  story that excludes itself when it is reached holds no subject of the run, so
  every baseline it left, under its own id and at each width, is named. A
  shard prices the story at the sum of the widths its last visit read.

  If you write a collector, `collect` may now return a `Visit` instead of a
  `Collected`: every subject the visit to the planned one produced, each with its own
  result, each id the planned id or the planned id at a width (`<id>@<width>`),
  and any warnings the visit raised. A visit that could not learn every subject
  it realizes, such as a story read without its parameters, says `incomplete: true`.
  A visit that produced no subject is
  reported as a failed one, and so is a visit that produced any other id. The run and `variance collect` report each subject
  at the position the plan gave the planned subject, and evidence parts record
  the planned id as `of`; a merge refuses a part whose subject is neither. A
  `--subjects` glob that names one width, such as `*@375`, now reaches the story
  it comes from, and only a width suffix extends a story id: `button--primary`
  no longer reaches `button--primary-large`.

  `@variance-authority/core/format` exports `atWidth`, which writes a subject's
  id and name at a width, and `widenedFrom`, which reads the planned id back
  from a width id, and `realizes`, which says whether a visit to one id may
  produce another.

  `readParameters(page)` is now `readParameters(page, storyId)` and returns one
  story's parameters; the up-front read of every story is gone.
- 8c64aa2: Each width of a subject is named apart

  A subject read at several widths already became one subject per width, with
  `@375` on its id. Its name now carries the width the same way, so a baseline
  path filed by title and name writes one file per width.
- 406dffd: The capture harness now starts Chromium with the same text settings the renderer paints with (`--font-render-hinting=none`, `--disable-lcd-text`). On Linux, a page laid out with hinting and painted without it wrapped lines differently, so its painted image came out a different height from the layout it was read from.
- 98d19d2: A subject set in a web font is painted in it, and a change to the font file changes its key

  Pruning kept only the rules that match an element, and an `@font-face` matches
  none, so a render document named a family it never declared and every render
  painted the fallback. `acquireDocument` now carries each face whose family
  appears in a computed `font-family` inside the subject or in a box its
  frame generates, such as `body::before`, with its `url()`s
  rewritten against the page, and `referencedAssets` adds the face's files to the
  asset key. A face the subject is not set in is still pruned. Under jsdom, which
  drops a face's `src`, the face is not carried and `acquireDocument` reports
  `unreadable-font-face`.

  The Playwright renderer paints a document on `about:blank`, where a face its
  page served from its own origin is a cross-origin font that the browser refuses
  without CORS headers. For a document that is not resource-closed and carries a
  face, the renderer now fetches font requests itself and answers them with
  `access-control-allow-origin: *`, as it already does for a closed document.

  Baselines of subjects set in a web font move on the first run after upgrading:
  the image is painted in the face rather than the fallback, and the key holds
  the face's file. Review them and accept them once.

### Minor Changes

- 1a0b845: A subject is read with nothing hovered, nothing focused, motion reduced and `Date` fixed

  Every layout and raster baseline made before this release is compared under a
  moved recipe once; a semantic baseline, read in jsdom, does not move. The
  default recipes gained tricks, so the stabilization digest every reading records
  has changed, and each subject names that recipe as the cause of whatever it
  reports. Review the changes and adopt them with `variance accept --all`, as for
  any recipe change.

  The standard collection recipe now also holds:

  - `no-hover`: the pointer is moved to `(-1, -1)`, off the page, once per page
    before it loads. On the `variance` fixture's page it is moved again before
    every observation, a frame each, and not put back: a menu a script opened on
    hover is closed for your test's next step.
  - `no-focus`: whatever holds focus is blurred before the subject is read,
    including an element inside a shadow root. On a page your test or agent goes
    on using, focus goes back to that element once the reading and any screenshot
    of it are taken, so a test types where it left off. The blur still ran the
    page's blur handlers, and what they did, such as a validate-on-blur error,
    stays.
  - `reduced-motion`: the browser reports `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`, which
    stops the script animations of a page that honours it, and the reading
    declares the same preference among the conditions its `@media` rules are
    resolved against. A `prefers-reduced-motion` condition you declare through
    `createHarness`'s `features` wins, and the browser is asked for that value;
    a declared `no-preference` is not recorded as `reduced-motion`. Rules under
    `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)` are not read by default;
    leave `reduced-motion` out to read them.
  - `freeze-clock`: `Date` reads one instant. A script added before the page's
    own replaces `new Date()`, `Date()` and `Date.now()`, and gives the same
    instant to `Intl.DateTimeFormat`'s `format()` and `formatToParts()` called
    without a date. Timers, animation frames and `performance.now()` are the
    browser's own, so a page that settles on a timer still settles. No Playwright
    clock is installed, so `page.clock` stays yours, and a clock your test
    installs replaces the fixed `Date`; the reading still records `freeze-clock`,
    so leave it out of the list when your test owns the clock. `Temporal.Now` and
    `Date` inside a worker are not fixed. The default instant is in the past, and
    the browser's cookie store keeps real time: a cookie your page's script sets
    with an expiry counted from `Date.now()` is already expired and is not
    stored, so a dismissed consent banner can come back after the next
    navigation. Set `varianceNow` or `now` near today, or leave `freeze-clock`
    out.

  The render and layout recipes gain `no-focus` alone, because a painted document
  still honours a collected `autofocus`. The other three have nothing to act on
  there: the date the page printed is already text in the document, and its
  `@media` rules were resolved when it was read. A `<script>` inside a subject
  root is carried into the render document and runs there under the real clock.
  Every document is painted under the render recipe, so a reading taken without
  `no-focus` is still painted blurred.

  The instant defaults to `DEFAULT_NOW`, `2024-06-15T12:00:00.000Z`, exported
  from `@variance-authority/core/format`. `routeCollector` and
  `storybookCollector` take a `now` option to choose another. It must be an ISO
  8601 instant with its zone; anything else is refused before a browser opens.
  An instant other than the default is spelled in the clock's id,
  `freeze-clock@<instant>`, so it is part of the environment key, and a baseline taken at one instant is compared
  with a run at another with the moved instant named as the cause.

  To read a subject hovered, focused, animated or at the real time, pass your own
  `stabilize` list without that trick: `DEFAULT_STABILIZE`, the ids of the
  default recipe, filtered, as in
  `DEFAULT_STABILIZE.filter((id) => id !== 'freeze-clock')`. It is exported from
  `@variance-authority/core/format`, `@variance-authority/route-collector`,
  `@variance-authority/storybook-collector` and
  `@variance-authority/playwright-test`. `storybookCollector` and `observe` in
  `@variance-authority/playwright-test` now take `stabilize`, as `routeCollector`
  already did.

  A trick needs a browser driver to apply it, and is recorded only where one did.
  The collectors apply all four. So does the `variance` fixture in
  `@variance-authority/playwright-test`: it sets `reduced-motion` and
  `freeze-clock` on the `page` it hands your test, before the test body runs, and
  takes the pointer off the page and releases focus before every observation,
  giving focus back after it. Two new fixture options, `varianceStabilize` and
  `varianceNow`, choose what it sets and the instant, and are set with
  `test.use`; `varianceDriven` holds the ids it set. A fixed `Date` stops code
  that times itself with `Date.now()`: a debounce or a throttle, such as lodash's
  `debounce`, sees no time pass and never fires, so a test that types into a
  debounced search box can stop getting results after this upgrade. A loop that
  waits for `Date.now()` to pass a mark hangs the page, an animation timed by
  `Date`, such as jQuery's `animate`, never calls its `complete`, and a client
  that checks a token's `nbf` or `iat` against `Date.now()` can refuse a token
  issued today. None of these failures names the clock. Leave
  `freeze-clock` out for such a test, and for one that sets `page.clock` itself:

  ```ts
  import { DEFAULT_STABILIZE } from '@variance-authority/playwright-test';

  test.use({ varianceStabilize: DEFAULT_STABILIZE.filter((id) => id !== 'freeze-clock') });
  ```

  On a page the fixture never handed your test,
  such as one opened from your own browser context, call the new
  `driveBeforeTest(page)` before `page.goto()` to set the same two; `observe` and
  `createVariance` there apply `no-hover` and `no-focus`.
  `@variance-authority/vitest-browser` reads from inside your page and has no
  driver; `@variance-authority/presentation` reads through the Playwright `Page`
  you hand it, a test's or an agent's live browser, and does not drive it. Both
  apply `no-focus` only, giving focus back once the reading is taken. A trick left out is absent from the
  reading's ids and digest, as a trick a tier cannot reach already is.
  `stabilizeForObservation` in `@variance-authority/dom` takes `driven`, the ids
  your driver applied, and returns `refocus()`, which gives focus back to the
  element the reading released. `stabilizeAsRequested` takes the recipe by id, as
  a page agent receives it. `createHarness` in `@variance-authority/playwright`
  takes a `stabilize` recipe to drive its page before the first navigation, and
  reports the ids it applied as `driven`. `createObservedHarness` opens one with
  `observeNetwork` started before its first navigation, as both collectors do.

  `createPlaywrightRenderer` no longer couples `no-focus` to `waitForFonts`:
  `waitForFonts: false` turns off the waits alone.

  `@variance-authority/core/format` exports `DEFAULT_STABILIZE`, `DEFAULT_NOW`,
  `driveBeforeLoad` and `driveBeforeRead`, which apply the driver tricks to a
  Playwright `Page`, `forDriver`, which drops the ones a host did not apply,
  `featuresOf`, which declares the motion preference a recipe drove, and
  `recipeToDrive`, which resolves a `stabilize` list and checks `now` before a
  browser opens.
- d432339: A page reads its clock in UTC and formats for en-US, not for the host

  The harness the route and Storybook collectors open, and the pages the renderer
  paints, took their timezone and locale from the machine. A date the page
  formatted read one way on a laptop in Sydney and another on a runner in
  Virginia, from one build, and the two compared against one baseline as
  `changed`.

  Both are pinned: `timezoneId` to `UTC` and `locale` to `en-US`. Declare either
  in `variance.config.json` (`"timezoneId": "Europe/Berlin"`, `"locale":
  "de-DE"`) and the collectors and the renderer pin that instead; an unknown
  timezone or a malformed language tag is refused by its field.
  `createHarness` and `createPlaywrightRenderer` take the same two options.
  `@variance-authority/core/format` exports their type, `PageRegion`, and
  `@variance-authority/playwright` exports `pinnedRegion`, which fills in `UTC`
  and `en-US` for a field left out.

  Both are part of the environment key, and the renderer's pair is part of
  `RenderIdentity.rasterization`. A capture read in another timezone or language
  is another environment, and an image painted in one is compared with a
  baseline painted in another, with `rasterization` named as the cause of
  whatever moved.

  `@variance-authority/playwright-test` paints each test in the timezone and
  locale its page runs in: whatever the Playwright project or `test.use` sets.
  When neither sets a `timezoneId`, `varianceFixtures` opens the page in `UTC`
  rather than the host's, so a laptop and a runner in UTC read it under one key;
  Playwright Test already opens it in `en-US` when nothing sets a `locale`. That
  reaches every test of a suite extended with `varianceFixtures`, including tests
  that never call `variance`, so a test that asserts a date formatted in your
  machine's timezone reads it in `UTC` after this upgrade; set `timezoneId` in
  `use` to keep your own. A page
  you hand to `createVariance` is read and painted in whatever its own context
  opened it in, which is the host's timezone when that context set none: open the
  context with `timezoneId: 'UTC'` to match. `varianceRenderer` is now a test fixture, chosen
  by the page, and `varianceRenderers` is the worker's set of renderers, one per
  timezone and locale; a project that overrode `varianceRenderer` at worker scope
  overrides it at test scope instead.

  **Every image painted by the Playwright renderer is compared under a moved
  recipe once after this upgrade**, because its recipe now carries the timezone
  and locale. Each subject names `rasterization` as the cause of what it reports,
  and one whose pixels moved is `changed`:

  - With `variance run`: the run exits `1` for each `changed` subject. Review
    them in `variance report --format html` and adopt them with
    `variance accept --all`. A rerun reports `unchanged`.
  - With `@variance-authority/playwright-test`: the suite fails each `changed`
    test, and `--update-snapshots=changed` adopts them.
  - With `@variance-authority/vitest-browser`: `vitest --update` adopts them, as
    `variance accept --all` does.

  `@variance-authority/vitest-browser` reads no `variance.config.json` and takes no
  timezone or locale, so it paints in `UTC` and `en-US` whatever its tab ran in,
  and neither it nor `@variance-authority/unit-test` writes a timezone or locale
  to the environment key.
- 754d04c: The port a build is served on is no part of a render

  The route and Storybook collectors serve a build on a free port, and that port
  reached three identities. An asset the page loaded was keyed by its absolute
  URL, a `url()` in a computed style was the absolute URL the engine resolved,
  and the document digest read both. One build served twice therefore read as two
  environment keys and two documents: each run missed the render cache, painted
  again, and read its document as changed against its own baseline.

  An asset the page's own origin serves is keyed by its path, and the page's
  origin is dropped from a `url()` before it is hashed. An asset another origin
  serves keeps its absolute URL. A capture carries the page's `baseUrl` so core
  knows which origin is the page's, and the renderer resolves a path-keyed asset
  against the document's `baseUrl`. `documentDigest` reads the page's own base
  and resources as paths, so one build served on two ports addresses one render
  and the render cache hits; the document keeps them absolute for the renderer,
  and a resource another origin serves stays absolute in the digest too.

  A `@variance-authority/unit-test` capture keys its assets the same way, so a
  `@variance-authority/vitest-browser` observation, which captures through it on
  the port the runner had free, keeps the port out of its environment key.
  `readCapture` reads back a capture whose asset is keyed by path, resolving the
  key against the document's `baseUrl` as the renderer does; `assetUrl` in
  `@variance-authority/core/format` is that one resolution.

  **The document of every page served over `http` moves once after this
  upgrade.** `documentDigest` now reads a document's base and resources without
  the page's origin, so the digest of every document served over `http` or
  `https` changes: every route, every story, every Vitest browser page, and every
  Playwright page opened by URL. A moved document misses the render cache once,
  and its image is still compared with the baseline: a page whose pixels did not
  move reads `unchanged`, and one whose pixels did reads `changed`, which
  `variance accept --all` and Playwright's `--update-snapshots=changed` adopt.
  `RULESET_VERSION` moves from `r1` to `r2`. The ruleset is part of a snapshot's
  environment key, not of the render recipe, so no image names it as a moved
  identity; a snapshot diffed against one recorded under `r1` names the ruleset as its
  environment root.

### Patch Changes

- ef496ad: READMEs name what the program does

  The package READMEs, and the `@variance-authority/vantage` and
  `@variance-authority/playwright-test` descriptions, no longer write a test, a
  record or a run as something that says, asks or knows. Each sentence names what
  the program does: a command prints, a record holds a field, a test runs or
  covers. Where a value is filled in from configuration or a default rather than
  recorded, the README says so. Four renamed headings change their anchors:
  `help`'s "Where the declaration is undocumented", `playwright`'s "Where a
  component is declared, read from the engine", `storybook`'s "What a pass sends
  the preview" and `sense`'s "Correct what a file's text declares it imports".

### Minor Changes

- 3fdec67: The rasterization key stops reading the recipe

  `RenderIdentity` carries two digests over a render's inputs, and they overlapped.
  `stabilization` names the recipe by which tricks are present, so a trick that
  changes how it reaches the page is the same recipe and keeps the same digest.
  `rasterization` was digesting `{ type: 'png', ...recipeScreenshot(recipe) }`,
  which put the recipe's spelling into a second key that has no opinion about
  recipes — and the two then disagreed about whether anything had changed.

  0.2.0 is what that costs. `hideCaret` moved from `screenshot: { caret: 'hide' }`
  to a `caret-color` stylesheet, because the driver's caret switch writes `style`
  back onto every focusable element and the in-place path reads the DOM on both
  sides of a screenshot. Same trick, same id, and the images come out
  byte-identical — verified against a stored baseline from 0.1.1. Every baseline
  went `incomparable` anyway, over a key that moved for a reason no pixel could
  have shown.

  `rasterization` now covers what the machine decides and no recipe asked for:
  which engine, launched headless or not, with which ordered launch arguments,
  photographed into which format. The recipe's contribution reaches the image
  through `screenshot` exactly as before and reaches the identity through
  `stabilization`, once.

  The key therefore moves once more, and stored baselines are `incomparable`
  against this version — `accept` them and it stops happening. A run that reports
  `incomparable` is reporting correctly: an identity it cannot compare has never
  been a diff, and the verdict machinery behaved throughout. What was wrong was
  the key.

### Minor Changes

- e546e21: A subject is allowed to reference something that is not there

  A fixture that points an `<img>` at a path nobody serves is testing the fallback,
  and the broken state is the subject. Capture had no way to say so: the resolver
  returned bytes or the capture was refused, so Material UI's CardMedia,
  ImageListItem and Avatar suites — which all reference a deliberately absent
  `/fake.png` — could not be captured at all.

  `resolveResource` may answer `{ absent: true }`. The resource is recorded with
  its status, and the renderer answers that status instead of counting the request
  as one the document failed to carry.
- e546e21: A subject with no pixels is a baseline without an image, not a subject that got away

  A wrapper whose only child went to a portal, or a conformance mount with no
  children, occupies nothing. Refusing to photograph it is right; refusing the
  subject was not. On Material UI's unit tier that was 1109 of 4371 subjects
  reported as unobserved while the capture held their markup, their rules, their
  component hashes and their accessibility tree — none of which was in doubt.

  `Raster` makes the image optional: `bytes`, `width` and `height` are absent
  together or present together, and `pictured` is the one place that narrows all
  three. Absent means *this subject has no pixels*, which is a measurement — it
  never means the image was lost. `occupiesPixels` asks the same question of a
  record read without bytes, which is the only form a sidecar takes. `observe`
  gets a second tier in `unpictured.ts`, where the comparison such a subject can
  still take — document digest, component hashes, accessibility — is the whole
  verdict. `promotionOf` promotes the sidecar alone when there is no `after`,
  because the subject reached a verdict and the only missing half is the one a
  camera would have produced.

  The file-backed store carries the same nullable pair, and with it the split of a
  baseline's two halves into two path prefixes. `identities` scans the record root,
  because a subject with no pixels has no image directory to be found in and the
  sibling scan would otherwise call another machine's baseline new.

  Capture stops handing this to Playwright to fail on. Both screenshot paths used
  to refuse a zero-area subject in terms of their own arguments — the clip path
  with `Expected options.clip.height to be greater than 0`, the element path by
  spending the full actionability timeout and then complaining about visibility —
  so a reader had a component that rendered nothing and a sentence about a
  rectangle. `captureSubject` decides it now, and the renderer names the subject.

  **Operators:** this is schema **18**. `baselines` and `render_cache` drop
  `NOT NULL` from `width` and `height`, shipped as `0016_pixel-less-baselines.sql`.
  Apply it before pointing a CLI of this version at the deployment; `GET /version`
  reports the schema a build expects.
