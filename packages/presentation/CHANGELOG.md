### Minor Changes

- 009b089: A presentation signal with one side missing is `changed`, not `incomparable`.

  A side with no presentation reading, or a reading with no layout findings, now
  gives `verdict: 'changed'` with a `because` that names that side and no effects.
  This is the rule ADR-0090 already applies to one-sided accessibility evidence.
  The signal still changes no subject's verdict.

  `presentationSignal` returns `undefined` when neither side was measured, with
  no reading or no layout findings on both sides, so the member stays absent
  rather than holding a signal about nothing.
  `PresentationSignalRecord` no longer has an `incomparable` variant: tell a
  one-sided record from a compared one by `'because' in signal`. A run-report
  file whose presentation signal says `incomparable` is refused when read.
- 85e4e01: `sensePresentation` rejects a subject whose React Suspense boundary is still
  pending when the `suspense.timeoutMs` bound is reached, and names the subject.
  It used to sense the fallback as the presentation. A subject that is its
  loading state passes `loading: true`, and its fallback is sensed on purpose.

### Minor Changes

- 1a0b845: A subject is read with nothing hovered, nothing focused, motion reduced and `Date` fixed

  Every layout and raster baseline made before this release is compared under a
  moved recipe once; a semantic baseline, read in jsdom, does not move. The
  default recipes gained tricks, so the stabilization digest every reading records
  has changed, and each subject names that recipe as the cause of whatever it
  reports. Review the changes and adopt them with `variance accept --all`, as for
  any recipe change.

  The standard collection recipe now also holds:

  - `no-hover`: the pointer is moved to `(-1, -1)`, off the page, once per page
    before it loads. On the `variance` fixture's page it is moved again before
    every observation, a frame each, and not put back: a menu a script opened on
    hover is closed for your test's next step.
  - `no-focus`: whatever holds focus is blurred before the subject is read,
    including an element inside a shadow root. On a page your test or agent goes
    on using, focus goes back to that element once the reading and any screenshot
    of it are taken, so a test types where it left off. The blur still ran the
    page's blur handlers, and what they did, such as a validate-on-blur error,
    stays.
  - `reduced-motion`: the browser reports `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`, which
    stops the script animations of a page that honours it, and the reading
    declares the same preference among the conditions its `@media` rules are
    resolved against. A `prefers-reduced-motion` condition you declare through
    `createHarness`'s `features` wins, and the browser is asked for that value;
    a declared `no-preference` is not recorded as `reduced-motion`. Rules under
    `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)` are not read by default;
    leave `reduced-motion` out to read them.
  - `freeze-clock`: `Date` reads one instant. A script added before the page's
    own replaces `new Date()`, `Date()` and `Date.now()`, and gives the same
    instant to `Intl.DateTimeFormat`'s `format()` and `formatToParts()` called
    without a date. Timers, animation frames and `performance.now()` are the
    browser's own, so a page that settles on a timer still settles. No Playwright
    clock is installed, so `page.clock` stays yours, and a clock your test
    installs replaces the fixed `Date`; the reading still records `freeze-clock`,
    so leave it out of the list when your test owns the clock. `Temporal.Now` and
    `Date` inside a worker are not fixed. The default instant is in the past, and
    the browser's cookie store keeps real time: a cookie your page's script sets
    with an expiry counted from `Date.now()` is already expired and is not
    stored, so a dismissed consent banner can come back after the next
    navigation. Set `varianceNow` or `now` near today, or leave `freeze-clock`
    out.

  The render and layout recipes gain `no-focus` alone, because a painted document
  still honours a collected `autofocus`. The other three have nothing to act on
  there: the date the page printed is already text in the document, and its
  `@media` rules were resolved when it was read. A `<script>` inside a subject
  root is carried into the render document and runs there under the real clock.
  Every document is painted under the render recipe, so a reading taken without
  `no-focus` is still painted blurred.

  The instant defaults to `DEFAULT_NOW`, `2024-06-15T12:00:00.000Z`, exported
  from `@variance-authority/core/format`. `routeCollector` and
  `storybookCollector` take a `now` option to choose another. It must be an ISO
  8601 instant with its zone; anything else is refused before a browser opens.
  An instant other than the default is spelled in the clock's id,
  `freeze-clock@<instant>`, so it is part of the environment key, and a baseline taken at one instant is compared
  with a run at another with the moved instant named as the cause.

  To read a subject hovered, focused, animated or at the real time, pass your own
  `stabilize` list without that trick: `DEFAULT_STABILIZE`, the ids of the
  default recipe, filtered, as in
  `DEFAULT_STABILIZE.filter((id) => id !== 'freeze-clock')`. It is exported from
  `@variance-authority/core/format`, `@variance-authority/route-collector`,
  `@variance-authority/storybook-collector` and
  `@variance-authority/playwright-test`. `storybookCollector` and `observe` in
  `@variance-authority/playwright-test` now take `stabilize`, as `routeCollector`
  already did.

  A trick needs a browser driver to apply it, and is recorded only where one did.
  The collectors apply all four. So does the `variance` fixture in
  `@variance-authority/playwright-test`: it sets `reduced-motion` and
  `freeze-clock` on the `page` it hands your test, before the test body runs, and
  takes the pointer off the page and releases focus before every observation,
  giving focus back after it. Two new fixture options, `varianceStabilize` and
  `varianceNow`, choose what it sets and the instant, and are set with
  `test.use`; `varianceDriven` holds the ids it set. A fixed `Date` stops code
  that times itself with `Date.now()`: a debounce or a throttle, such as lodash's
  `debounce`, sees no time pass and never fires, so a test that types into a
  debounced search box can stop getting results after this upgrade. A loop that
  waits for `Date.now()` to pass a mark hangs the page, an animation timed by
  `Date`, such as jQuery's `animate`, never calls its `complete`, and a client
  that checks a token's `nbf` or `iat` against `Date.now()` can refuse a token
  issued today. None of these failures names the clock. Leave
  `freeze-clock` out for such a test, and for one that sets `page.clock` itself:

  ```ts
  import { DEFAULT_STABILIZE } from '@variance-authority/playwright-test';

  test.use({ varianceStabilize: DEFAULT_STABILIZE.filter((id) => id !== 'freeze-clock') });
  ```

  On a page the fixture never handed your test,
  such as one opened from your own browser context, call the new
  `driveBeforeTest(page)` before `page.goto()` to set the same two; `observe` and
  `createVariance` there apply `no-hover` and `no-focus`.
  `@variance-authority/vitest-browser` reads from inside your page and has no
  driver; `@variance-authority/presentation` reads through the Playwright `Page`
  you hand it, a test's or an agent's live browser, and does not drive it. Both
  apply `no-focus` only, giving focus back once the reading is taken. A trick left out is absent from the
  reading's ids and digest, as a trick a tier cannot reach already is.
  `stabilizeForObservation` in `@variance-authority/dom` takes `driven`, the ids
  your driver applied, and returns `refocus()`, which gives focus back to the
  element the reading released. `stabilizeAsRequested` takes the recipe by id, as
  a page agent receives it. `createHarness` in `@variance-authority/playwright`
  takes a `stabilize` recipe to drive its page before the first navigation, and
  reports the ids it applied as `driven`. `createObservedHarness` opens one with
  `observeNetwork` started before its first navigation, as both collectors do.

  `createPlaywrightRenderer` no longer couples `no-focus` to `waitForFonts`:
  `waitForFonts: false` turns off the waits alone.

  `@variance-authority/core/format` exports `DEFAULT_STABILIZE`, `DEFAULT_NOW`,
  `driveBeforeLoad` and `driveBeforeRead`, which apply the driver tricks to a
  Playwright `Page`, `forDriver`, which drops the ones a host did not apply,
  `featuresOf`, which declares the motion preference a recipe drove, and
  `recipeToDrive`, which resolves a `stabilize` list and checks `now` before a
  browser opens.

### Patch Changes

- b065364: `::before` and `::after` are read as children of the element they hang from

  Restyling or rewording a `::before` or `::after` box used to repaint the page
  and move no hash: the rules written for it were matched against the element,
  failed, and were dropped from both the snapshot and the render document. A
  generated box now enters the capture as a child node tagged `::before` (first)
  or `::after` (last), carrying the rules written for it. In a browser it carries
  its computed style, projected onto the allowlist, and the text its `content`
  says as a `#text` child; a box whose `content` is `none` or `normal`, or whose
  `display` is `none`, is not in the tree. Strings are joined and `attr()` reads
  the element's attribute; a part such as `counter()` or `open-quote` is carried
  as written.

  Under JSDOM, which computes no generated content, the declared rules answer,
  picked by the same cascade order normalization uses: a box is in the tree when
  the winning `content` gives it one and the winning `display` is not `none`, with the rules that style it and no computed style.
  When that `content` is strings and `attr()`, the box says its words as a
  `#text` child, as in a browser, so rewording it moves the snapshot. When it
  holds a `counter()`, a quote, a `var()` or a `url()`, the box has no text and
  carries `unread` on `RawNode` and `SemanticNode`, naming the parts it could not
  resolve; `unread` is outside every hash. JSDOM's own parser drops a `content`
  that is a single `attr()` or `counter()` and nothing else, so no box is read
  for one.

  This is part of `RULESET_VERSION` `r2`, the same `r2` that keeps the served
  port out of a render. A subject with a `::before` or `::after` box has a new
  render document, so after this upgrade its image shows the box and reads
  `changed`; `variance accept --all` and Playwright's
  `--update-snapshots=changed` adopt it.
- ef496ad: READMEs name what the program does

  The package READMEs, and the `@variance-authority/vantage` and
  `@variance-authority/playwright-test` descriptions, no longer write a test, a
  record or a run as something that says, asks or knows. Each sentence names what
  the program does: a command prints, a record holds a field, a test runs or
  covers. Where a value is filled in from configuration or a default rather than
  recorded, the README says so. Four renamed headings change their anchors:
  `help`'s "Where the declaration is undocumented", `playwright`'s "Where a
  component is declared, read from the engine", `storybook`'s "What a pass sends
  the preview" and `sense`'s "Correct what a file's text declares it imports".

### Minor Changes

- 5b2a28f: Carry the caller-established font identities onto the presentation report.

  `sensePresentation` accepted a `fonts` option, threaded it into the capture it
  builds, then analyzed that capture and dropped it — so through the live door the
  option had no observable consequence: three different font lists produced a
  byte-identical report. The report now carries them, from the capture, so the
  pure entry point answers the same way.

  Fonts are a render input of the more consequential kind — a substitution moves
  every metric on the page without changing a byte of code — so the identities
  participate in `digest` and a reading taken under different ones is a different
  reading. `contentDigest` is untouched: content identity is what has to survive
  presentation moving. Absent rather than empty when none were established, and
  sorted, because the order a caller listed them in is not part of their identity.
