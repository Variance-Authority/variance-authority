### Minor Changes

- 26ae9ed: Distinguish the React component instance that initiated a commit from every
  component whose render body ran because of it.

  The commit tap retains `memoizedUpdaters` as bounded structural component paths,
  and Eyes records those commits in the authored test chronology. The MCP testing
  surface places update initiators inside or outside the component paths a test
  addressed while keeping whole-test source execution separate.

  Export bounded read-only Fiber subtree, parent-chain, component-path, and source
  location helpers for diagnostics that already hold a Fiber.
- 5c34e6d: Say which input moved, not just which tag did

  `partingOf(baseline, candidate)` climbs from a set of deltas to the component
  boundary that owns them and names the input that carried the decision:
  `Cart chose differently — useState #0 moved`, with `Summary` reported as having
  been handed a different `expanded` and hanging under that line as a
  manifestation rather than as a second finding. `explainParting` renders that
  as lines. Two runs of one page that differ in a `<p>` where the other has a
  `<span>` previously produced a structural delta and nothing to say about it;
  the tag is now the symptom and the hook cell is the report.

  `holdingOf` from `@variance-authority/react` supplies the evidence — props,
  context values and hook cells as digests, per boundary, including
  `useSyncExternalStore` snapshots so a store that moved outside React is
  distinguished from a component that decided differently on its own. Values are
  never carried, only digests, and a holding reaches no hash: `renderHash`,
  `structureHash`, `styleHash`, band-exact component digests and
  `componentInstances` are all unmoved by it, the same bargain `styleProvenance`
  makes. `collect` in `@variance-authority/dom` takes `holdingOf` as a
  caller-supplied reader, opt in separately from `wiringOf`, and `capture` in
  `@variance-authority/unit-test` now accepts `provenanceOf`, `wiringOf` and
  `holdingOf` so a unit test can read one.

  A boundary whose own input could not be read is reported as `unread` and never
  as nondeterminism: `undetermined` is reserved for a component whose every input
  was read and agreed. A wrapper that roots a component boundary no longer
  collapses, because collapsing it discarded the holding — the cost is that a run
  reading holdings keeps wrappers a run without them removes, which is why both
  sides of a comparison must be read the same way.

  A component that ran no hooks is read as having run none, rather than as
  unreadable. React writes `_debugHookTypes = null` on every fiber and fills it on
  the first hook call, so the property's absence is the only silence — and
  collapsing the two reported the one shape most worth calling nondeterministic, a
  component with no props and no hooks that renders differently twice, as
  something nothing could be said about.

  `PartedBoundary.moved` names the properties the owned deltas named — `color`,
  `padding-top`, `width` — and `explainParting` spends them on the delta line.
  That is the last joint of the chain the rungs climb: a hook cell moved, a prop
  carried it down, and this is what the prop turned into on the page. A count and
  a band stop one link short of what somebody chasing a visual regression is
  trying to name.

  `Parting.slice` answers the question asked before which input moved: is this
  worth opening. Three facts are read independently — did the component tree
  move, did any input move, did the output move — and the combinations collapse
  to six sentences. `refactor` is the one that pays for the rest: a component
  tree that moved while the page did not is the receipt a refactor never gets,
  since a pixel differ can say the screenshots match and nothing about what was
  rewritten underneath. `flake` is `settled`'s opposite number and is refused on
  silence — a run that read no boundary reports `unread`, never `flake`.

  `explainParting` leads with that line, and stops enumerating manifestations
  past three: one input at a fork can put a boundary on every component beneath
  it, and nine lines carrying one decision bury the one line worth reading.

  The whole layer is documented in `docs/parting.md`: the six slices, the seven
  rungs, what a holding carries and what it deliberately does not.
