### Minor Changes

- 1d402d1: Carry the narrowing coordinate in the report, and print it in the summary header.

  A `RunReport` now holds `narrowing`: the ref the run was told to observe from,
  and where the recorded execution index stands — the commit it was written at and
  how many files the working tree differs from it by. A run that narrowed nothing
  carries the second half alone, so the coordinate is present whether or not it was
  spent.

  `variance_summary` prints it. Narrowing is an option and stays one; what this
  refuses is the state where an agent works against a suite for weeks without ever
  learning that an index is on disk and that the distance from it is a number. The
  line names the commit and spells out the `variance run --since` that would use
  it, and is omitted when there is no index, no position, or no distance.

  `run` takes the coordinate as `index` and acts on it for nothing else.
  `narrowingFor` resolves `since`, `against` and `index` together, so a caller
  assembling a run reaches one call rather than three.
