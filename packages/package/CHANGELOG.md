### Patch Changes

- b3c1bdf: `variance ask uses` and `ask symbol` answer for a name that no entry publishes but that another package imports by the path of its file, such as `addTax` from `@acme/lib/src/internal/math`. They no longer refuse it. Each import is listed with its file and line and marked as a deep import, past the entry the package declares, or as an import by path from a package that declares none. `symbol` also says where the name is declared and why nothing publishes it. A name that is exported without being published and that nothing imports is still refused, and the refusal names the file and line that export it.

  A workspace package with none of `exports`, `main`, `types` or `typings` is no longer skipped. `ask packages` and `ask entrypoint` list it by the files and names other packages import from it, each with the importer's file and line, and none of those imports are called deep. A `.js` `main` with no `types` and no `.d.ts` beside it opens at the `.ts` or `.tsx` source of the same stem, as TypeScript reads it.
- b3c1bdf: A workspace package with no `exports` publishes its bare name through `types`, `typings` or `main`, the first of them the manifest writes, in the order TypeScript reads them. `variance ask packages` lists it with the imports of it, and an import of any of its other files, such as `@acme/lib/src/internal/math`, is listed as reaching past its entrypoint. `ask symbol`, `ask uses` and `ask entrypoint` answer for the names its entry exports. Before, such a package opened nothing and was missing from every answer.
- 59be40a: A pnpm workspace's packages open, and `reach` walks past a file the diff deletes

  A root manifest with no `workspaces` reads its members from `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, so `ask entrypoint --package @mui/material` answers on Material UI. The list is read as YAML and its entries as globs, so an entry starting with `!` excludes what it matches, a `**` glob reads every member under it, and a list written at its key's own indent, in flow style or under a byte-order mark reads the same as any other. A member two entries match is read once. A bare `.js` export opens by the `.d.ts` written beside it, and a published name followed through a JavaScript module reads that declaration. A workspace that publishes no package says so in a sentence, where it printed an empty list.

  `variance reach --since <ref>` takes the files the diff deletes out of the walk and names them on stderr. A diff that only deletes refuses, and the refusal names the deleted files.
- 27a4713: An `exports` field written as conditions opens `.`, and a custom condition in `tsconfig.json` is followed

  An `exports` string, an array of fallbacks, or an object with no `.` key now publishes `.`, as Node reads it. Before, each condition key was taken as a subpath, which invented names such as `@tanstack/solid-querytanstack/custom-condition`. An object that mixes subpaths and conditions is refused and the manifest is named, because Node refuses to load it. A condition listed in the package's `tsconfig.json` `customConditions` (through `extends`) is followed to the source it names when it comes before `types`, so Zod's `@zod/source` and TanStack's `@tanstack/custom-condition` open their `src/` files. Every config in that `extends` chain is read as JSONC whatever its name, so a comment in a `tsconfig.base.json` is read rather than refused. A pattern target with no extension, such as `./src/v4/locales/*`, opens one subpath per TypeScript file it matches, spelt with the emitted extension. An import of a subpath that `exports` names exactly is no longer reported as reaching past a published entrypoint when that subpath's source could not be read; it is listed under unreadable instead.

### Patch Changes

- aa57273: `ask uses` finds a name your code reads off `import()` or `import * as`. It used to answer that nothing imported `narrowByJourneys` when `select-command.ts` read it as `selection.narrowByJourneys` after `const selection = await import(…)`. Such a site now names the line that loads the module, and an `import()` site says the module loads when that call runs, not when the file loads.

  The parse carries these reads as `members`, apart from each request's `bindings`, so test selection reads exactly what it read before. The source index moves to version 12 and the help snapshot to version 3, and each is rebuilt on the first question after the upgrade.

### Patch Changes

- d956ba1: Open an `exports` subpath written as a bare path or with its `types` nested
  under `import`/`require`. Only a top-level `types` condition was read, so a
  workspace using either of the two commonest shapes was reported as publishing
  packages that open no names at all — an empty `help-index.md`, an
  `llms.txt` of bare headings, and a `help-gaps.md` claiming every name carried a
  doc block.
