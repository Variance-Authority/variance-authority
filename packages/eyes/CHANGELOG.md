### Minor Changes

- 26ae9ed: Distinguish the React component instance that initiated a commit from every
  component whose render body ran because of it.

  The commit tap retains `memoizedUpdaters` as bounded structural component paths,
  and Eyes records those commits in the authored test chronology. The MCP testing
  surface places update initiators inside or outside the component paths a test
  addressed while keeping whole-test source execution separate.

  Export bounded read-only Fiber subtree, parent-chain, component-path, and source
  location helpers for diagnostics that already hold a Fiber.
