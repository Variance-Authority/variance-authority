## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- Say who expands the query

  `variance_locate` and `docs_search` match the words they are given and expand
  nothing: no thesaurus, no stemming past a trailing plural, no model. That was
  true before and said only in the source, so an agent holding `auth` against a
  repository that writes `CredentialGate` read a miss as an absence rather than as
  a wrong vocabulary, and asked the same question again in longer words.

  Both tools now say it in the description the caller reads, and both skills say what
  to do instead: ask again in a different kind of name — what the screen says, what a
  component is likely called, the file it is likely declared in — rather than a
  reworded description of the same thing. The caller holds the ticket and the
  codebase the word came from, which is the context a shipped synonym table would
  be guessing at.
