- 16f6dd6: Recorded file names are relative to the repository root

  The Jest, Vitest and Rstest wrappers, the Playwright reporter and the Storybook
  collector now name every file relative to the root of the git checkout the run
  starts in. Before, when the config was inside a package, file names were
  relative to Jest's `rootDir` or Vitest's `root`. A recording made from
  `packages/cart` said `src/cart.ts` where a diff says `packages/cart/src/cart.ts`,
  and the two never matched. `rootDir` and `root` still resolve the config and the
  relative paths in its options. Outside a git checkout, names are relative to the
  directory the run starts in.

  A recording that an earlier version made from a package-level config uses the
  old names, so record it again. `repositoryRoot`, exported from
  `@variance-authority/sense/test-selection`, returns the directory that file
  names are relative to.

- da23004: The per-case execution index is columns, and fits a CI artifact limit

  `cases: true` wrote its index as JSON, one object per crossing. On three real
  projects that measured 31 to 37 bytes per crossing: a suite whose snapshot is
  0.3 MB left a 27.2 MB file beside it, and every CI has a cap on what a job may
  upload.

  It goes through the same column codec the snapshot uses — a dictionary, parallel
  integer columns, zstd run coding — and the same three projects now write 0.46 MB,
  0.46 MB and 0.21 MB. Nothing about the model changed: `decodeExecutionIndex`
  returns the index `encodeExecutionIndex` was handed, field for field, and the
  optional `loaded` keeps the difference between unsaid and denied.

  The default path is `<coverage file>.cases.bin`. An `executionFile` you name
  `.json` is still written as JSON, at the size JSON costs, for a reader that has
  to have it — and `variance covering` and `variance distill` read either, telling
  them apart by the first byte, so a cache recorded before this still answers.

### Minor Changes

- 35da499: An Rstest suite can adopt this, in either of the two shapes it runs in

  [Rstest](https://rstest.rs) runs a suite in `jsdom` with no browser, and — since
  `@rstest/playwright` — hands a test body a live Playwright `Page`. Those are the
  two adoptions this project already has, under one runner, and neither of them
  worked.

  The deferred half needed nothing new: an Rstest test in `jsdom` writes a capture
  with `@variance-authority/unit-test` and a later `variance run` paints it, the
  same as any other unit runner. What was missing was the in-place half. A
  `@rstest/playwright` body has a `page` and no `TestInfo`, so the five facts an
  observation needs about its run — the subject id, the file that owns it, the
  colour scheme and scale it was painted at, and whether this run may approve
  anything — were not reachable.

  `@variance-authority/playwright-test/rstest` exports `runOf`, which reads them
  from three of the values the body destructures:

  ```js
  import { describe, test } from '@rstest/playwright';
  import { assertUnchanged, createVariance } from '@variance-authority/playwright-test';
  import { runOf } from '@variance-authority/playwright-test/rstest';

  describe('cart', () => {
    test('empty', async ({ page, task, expect, playwright }) => {
      const variance = await createVariance(page, runOf({ task, expect, playwright }), {
        materialization: { kind: 'in-place', browser: { headless: true } },
      });
      try {
        assertUnchanged(await variance.observe(page.locator('#cart')));
      } finally {
        await variance.close();
      }
    });
  });
  ```

  Three values rather than one context because Rstest refuses a test body whose
  first parameter is not an object pattern, so there is nothing whole to hand
  over. The subject id is the suite chain — `cart > empty` becomes `cart/empty` —
  and the file that owns it is the spec relative to the project root, so nothing
  in the test spells a name out.

  **Approval is `rstest run -u`, and only that.** Rstest's own default for a
  snapshot with no baseline is to write one, which is the absence Playwright
  spells `missing`; reading it as approval would promote an image out of the
  unreviewed run that produced it, so the adapter does not.

  No new package. An Rstest e2e test needs Playwright and a browser binary, which
  is what `@variance-authority/playwright-test` already asks of an adopter, and a
  second box would be a second name for one requirement.

  `cases/rstest-case` drives the real `rstest` CLI through both loops — capture,
  `variance accept`, `unchanged`; then failure, `-u`, agreement — and
  [`docs/start-rstest.md`](https://variance-authority.dev/docs/start-rstest) is
  the walkthrough.

### Minor Changes

- 8efba76: A run that changed ten files stops rewriting the whole selection index

  Every run after the first reads the selection index, lays its own recording over
  it, and writes it back. At a repository's scale almost all of that was spent
  making objects nobody reads: a run that re-records ten modules of twenty thousand
  decoded six hundred thousand regions into a model, merged ten of them, and
  encoded the model back — the other 99.95% of the index materialized and
  re-serialized to arrive at the bytes it was read from.

  `layerTestCoverage` does the merge and the encode as one pass over the columns
  the previous snapshot is already stored in. A module the run did not touch is
  never made an object: its rows are copied column to column as integers, its
  strings blob to blob as bytes, and the only thing that happens to either is the
  renumbering the new dictionary implies. Objects are made for what the merge has
  to reason about — the tests, the modules this run re-recorded, and the carried
  modules whose text moved on disk. Over twenty thousand modules that is 1855 ms to
  616, and it is byte for byte the same file, which a gate asserts across every
  case the merge distinguishes.

  The columns are now zstd rather than brotli, at two levels, because the runs are
  two kinds of data. A varint run is a dense stream of small integers and answers
  to a long search; a run of the string blob is file paths and hex digests, which
  zstd finds most of at level 1 and nothing more of above it. Against the brotli
  quality 4 it replaces, over the same snapshot: 319 ms to compress became 120, and
  the file got 86 KB smaller.

  `zlib.zstdCompressSync` arrived in Node 22.15, so that is the floor these
  packages declare. The snapshot's layout version moved with the codec, which means
  an index written by an earlier build is refused at its header and rebuilt — one
  full run, and nothing a reader has to think about.

### Patch Changes

- e546e21: A collector's complaints travel into the observation

  A finding produced at collection reached the CLI's record and nobody else. A
  suite driving this from its own runner asks the observation what is wrong with a
  subject, and the one diagnostic that explained the moved pixels — the host, not
  the stylesheet, chose the typeface — was produced, carried, and dropped one call
  short of the person reading the failure.

  `mergeDiagnostics` dedupes on every field, so the CLI, which now meets the same
  list twice, says a shared complaint once.
- e546e21: A subject with no pixels is a baseline without an image, not a subject that got away

  A wrapper whose only child went to a portal, or a conformance mount with no
  children, occupies nothing. Refusing to photograph it is right; refusing the
  subject was not. On Material UI's unit tier that was 1109 of 4371 subjects
  reported as unobserved while the capture held their markup, their rules, their
  component hashes and their accessibility tree — none of which was in doubt.

  `Raster` makes the image optional: `bytes`, `width` and `height` are absent
  together or present together, and `pictured` is the one place that narrows all
  three. Absent means *this subject has no pixels*, which is a measurement — it
  never means the image was lost. `occupiesPixels` asks the same question of a
  record read without bytes, which is the only form a sidecar takes. `observe`
  gets a second tier in `unpictured.ts`, where the comparison such a subject can
  still take — document digest, component hashes, accessibility — is the whole
  verdict. `promotionOf` promotes the sidecar alone when there is no `after`,
  because the subject reached a verdict and the only missing half is the one a
  camera would have produced.

  The file-backed store carries the same nullable pair, and with it the split of a
  baseline's two halves into two path prefixes. `identities` scans the record root,
  because a subject with no pixels has no image directory to be found in and the
  sibling scan would otherwise call another machine's baseline new.

  Capture stops handing this to Playwright to fail on. Both screenshot paths used
  to refuse a zero-area subject in terms of their own arguments — the clip path
  with `Expected options.clip.height to be greater than 0`, the element path by
  spending the full actionability timeout and then complaining about visibility —
  so a reader had a component that rendered nothing and a sentence about a
  rectangle. `captureSubject` decides it now, and the renderer names the subject.

  **Operators:** this is schema **18**. `baselines` and `render_cache` drop
  `NOT NULL` from `width` and `height`, shipped as `0016_pixel-less-baselines.sql`.
  Apply it before pointing a CLI of this version at the deployment; `GET /version`
  reports the schema a build expects.
- e546e21: Four ways a large unit tier lost subjects, none of which said so

  **The styling was gone before the capture looked.** A capture taken from a setup
  file runs in the outermost `afterEach` a run has; every hook registered inside a
  `describe` has already finished, and `onTestFinished` runs later still. CSS-in-JS
  teardown lives in exactly those inner hooks — emotion's test renderer removes each
  `<style>` tag it inserted — so the capture read the page with the styling taken
  back off it. The class names were all still in the markup, they matched nothing,
  and every subject captured, compared and passed against a photograph of unstyled
  DOM. Measured on Material UI's unit tier: 399 of 400 captures carried no CSS at
  all, and 1201 subjects laid out to zero height because nothing was sizing them.
  `retainStyles` records style elements as they are inserted and puts the removed
  ones back, in insertion order, for the length of one capture. The next test still
  gets a clean page.

  **A subject id can be longer than a filename.** A suite that names subjects after
  the test that produced them — a file path and a full test name — passes 255 bytes
  on ordinary tests, and the point of that convention is that the id says where the
  subject came from. `fileNameFor` in core is now the one rule: a readable prefix,
  plus a digest of the whole id when the id does not fit, because truncation alone
  merges two tests into one file. The baseline store, the capture archive, the
  CLI's image directory, the Playwright evidence directory and the Eyes journal all
  use it; before this, each was one long subject id away from a raw `ENAMETOOLONG`
  that never mentions a subject. `@variance-authority/eyes` declares
  `@variance-authority/core` directly rather than reaching it through `react` — the
  host stacks it keeps optional are Playwright and Testing Library, and a filename
  rule is not one of them.

  **An inline `url()` is spelled in entities.** `style="background-image:url(&quot;/a.png&quot;)"`
  reaches the scan through HTML serialization, and reading it literally asked the
  caller for bytes at a URL that exists nowhere but in the escaping. The HTML half
  is scanned with the attribute's entities undone; the stylesheet half, which was
  never escaped, is scanned as before.

  **A stubbed `getComputedStyle` is not a broken asset scan.** Replacing
  `window.getComputedStyle` with a map of the two properties a component reads is
  the only way to drive some layouts in jsdom. The scan called `getPropertyValue`
  on the plain object it got back, and every test in the file died on a `TypeError`
  raised four frames below anything you wrote. There is nothing to scan and nothing
  to complain about — whatever those styles would have named, the stub already
  removed from the page. The attributes on the element are still read.

### Minor Changes

- f09528d: Carry announcements and coverage on one medium, under one execution id.

  A run said two kinds of things about the same execution and had two ways of
  saying them: journeys reported coverage, events announced decisions, and each
  had its own idea of where home was. Configuring one did not configure the other,
  and a service that could talk about what it decided still could not say what it
  executed.

  `@variance-authority/wire` is that one medium. It resolves the carrier from the
  realm — a sink the driver installed, for a server the suite started inside
  itself, or a loopback return address the request arrived with on a cookie — so
  the same `collectEvents()` and `collectJourneys()` calls serve a page, a service
  in another process, and an in-process server without knowing which they are in.
  Told neither, a participant reports to nobody, which is what a request the run
  did not drive should do. The return address is refused unless it is `http:` on
  loopback, because whoever is talking to the service writes that cookie.

  Two guarantees ride the one wire, chosen by what a loss costs. An announcement
  is fire-and-forget with per-endpoint ordering: a lost one is a wait that times
  out loudly in the driver, holding the diagnosis. A coverage account is
  acknowledged and retried: a lost one is a test silently skipped on the next run,
  so a head counts what it lost and carries the count on later accounts, and a
  head that lost everything is silent, which already retires the run.

  Nothing at this level writes a file. A service is handed a `Cookie` header
  naming the execution and where to answer, and nothing else; the driver alone
  writes the coverage index.
- a87d008: Hold what a running suite is saying in a process an agent can ask, so a test in
  flight is something to look at rather than something to wait for.

  A suite already knows what nothing outside it can see: which realms answered and
  in what order, which work began and never finished, that a service is plainly
  talking while the test hearing it hears nothing. All of it is spent settling
  waits and then discarded, so nobody can ask it while it is true. A runner's
  timeout reports what a test *wanted* — the last thing the failure knows and the
  first thing the reader already knew.

  `@variance-authority/vantage` is the second reader. A watching process listens,
  the run reports, and the signals live in memory that outlives the test.
  `variance-authority-mcp --watch` is that process for an agent: it prints the one
  line the suite has to be started with, then answers `variance_run_signals` for
  where the run has got to and `variance_test_signals` for everything one
  execution has heard, in order, with the realm that said each and the work that
  started and never ended. Both answer while the test is still running, which is
  the point.

  The address is in the handshake, not only on stderr. A `Served` may carry
  `instructions`, and the watching one does: a set of tools about a run nobody has
  started yet reads as broken, and an agent told the variable after it has started
  the suite has been told one run too late.

  None of it is about visual regression. A test that takes no screenshot reports
  exactly what one that does reports, and a run started without
  `VARIANCE_AUTHORITY_VANTAGE` pays one environment read per worker.

  The medium is the wire the announcements already travel: one participant, `run`,
  and `channelTo` for a participant handed an address rather than sent one.
  `createEventLog` takes `onRecord` and `onRemark`, called at the moment of
  recording rather than at teardown — an answer that arrives when the test
  finishes answers a different question. `varianceWatched` is automatic so a
  listing has no holes.

  Still nothing written down. There is no report directory and no artifact to
  mistake for evidence later; what changes is only how long one execution lasts
  when somebody is watching.
