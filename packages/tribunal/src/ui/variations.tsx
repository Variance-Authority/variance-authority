 *
 * **The order is the point, and it is not the report's.** Two states come first,
 * because they are the two a reviewer can act on and both are silent everywhere
 * else:
 *
 * - **reaches nothing** — the pair renders to one hash. An A/B arm whose flag
 *   changes no pixel is an experiment measuring nothing, and it looks exactly like
 *   a healthy arm in every screenshot tool there is: two subjects, both
 *   `unchanged`, both green.
 * - **no parent in this run** — the declaration named a subject nothing observed.
 *   A broken link and an axis with nothing to say are not the same finding, so
 *   they are not drawn the same way.
 *
 * The rest follow by subject, which is the lattice's own order: a name that
 * extends another name sorts after it.
