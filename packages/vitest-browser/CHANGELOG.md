### Minor Changes

- 40a19b9: A committed baseline is named for its story or test

  Under `directory` and `lfs`, a baseline was written to
  `<root>/<identity digest>/<percent-encoded subject id>.png`, so a pull request
  that accepted one listed a 32-character hex directory nobody could check against
  the change, and each machine that accepted wrote its own copy. `baselines.path`
  is now a template rendered from what the subject is: `{dir}` and `{file}` (the
  file that declares it), `{title}`, `{name}`, `{id}`, `{project}` (the
  Playwright project's name, in the fixture's `varianceBaselinePath` only) and
  `{engine}` (the engine's family). The default, `{title}/{name}-{engine}`,
  writes `Ui/Button/Primary-chromium.png`;
  `{dir}/__baselines__/{file}/{name}-{engine}` with `root: "."` writes
  `src/ui/Button/__baselines__/Button.stories.tsx/Primary-chromium.png` beside the
  code. A label is spelled `Primary__dark-chromium.png`.

  The machine that painted a baseline is read from the record beside it. One file
  holds each subject per engine family, the last accept writes it, and a run on
  another platform, scale factor or engine version compares against it, reading
  unchanged or changed as the pixels say, with the moved field named as the cause.
  A laptop and CI that take turns accepting rewrite the record each time; set
  `baselines.records` to keep the records out of version control. The tribunal's
  bucket store answers the same way: a lookup reads the last accept on the
  engine family, where it used to prefer this machine's own row.

  Two subjects that render one path, compared case-folded, stop the run with an
  error naming both subjects and the template. Nothing is renumbered. The record
  names the subject it was accepted for, so a shard, a Playwright worker or a
  later run that renders the same path for another subject stops too. Two
  Playwright projects that differ only in scale factor, colour scheme or viewport
  render one path; the error names both projects and `{project}`. A record left by
  a project the config no longer runs is a renamed project's, and the first run
  under the new name takes it over.

  The Vitest plugin reads a test's `describe` path from the runner, so a title
  that contains ` > ` stays one directory under `{title}`.

  **Breaking:** `baselines.layout` is removed, and a config that sets it is
  refused with an error naming `path`. Baselines under the identity directories
  are still read: the subject is compared against them, unchanged or changed as
  the pixels say, with the move from the old path to the new one given as a cause,
  and the next accept writes the template's path and deletes the old pair, so the
  pull request shows a rename. An accept deletes only a pair this machine's
  identity or engine line painted; another machine's stays until that machine
  accepts. `BaselineKey` carries `file`, `title`, `name` and
  `project` in place of `path`; the Playwright fixture, the Vitest plugin and
  Storybook's index supply them, and `varianceBaselinePath` and `baselinePath`
  set the template for a suite run without the CLI.

  The git-LFS store's `.gitattributes` pattern and the action's commit-back
  pathspecs are the template's glob, so a collocated baseline is tracked and
  committed where it is written. An `lfs` config whose root is `.` and whose
  template has no directory of its own is refused, because its glob would track
  every hyphenated image in the repository; give the template a directory such
  as `__baselines__`, give the baselines a root of their own, or set
  `baselines.pattern`. A `directory` config at root `.` with such a template is
  refused for the same reason: the action would commit every hyphenated image
  back. An existing LFS root gets the template's pattern as a new
  `.gitattributes` line the next time a run opens it; commit it with the baselines.
- 0b6af81: A changed region is joined against the baseline's nodes as well as this render's

  A change that replaces an element paints over the old element's box and the new
  one's, and `attributeRegions` read only one snapshot. On todomvc's broken toggle,
  71% of the changed region is inside the checkbox that left and 88.75% inside the
  div that arrived. Neither reaches the 0.9 containment, so the region named the
  row around both.

  `AttributionOptions.before` is now required: the snapshot of the revision the
  pixels are compared against, or `undefined`. Each node is joined against the
  area its own box and the box of the node the differ's matcher pairs it with in
  `before` cover together: the two places, not the rectangle that holds both.
  A box that left is placed by where it was in its own image, whose corner is the
  new `AttributionOptions.beforeOrigin`: by default the before snapshot's root, so
  a subject the page moved between two clipped shots joins where its pixels are.
  A call that states `origin` with a `before` snapshot and no `beforeOrigin`
  throws, since a corner guessed from the other image is right only when the page
  did not move.

  A baseline keeps that snapshot. `Raster.snapshot` is a `PackedSnapshot`, the
  tree gzipped and in base64, written by the Playwright fixture, its promotion,
  the Vitest browser provider and the CLI's image sidecars. `packSnapshot` and
  `unpackSnapshot` are exported from `@variance-authority/observe`. Every store
  carries it as text: `sidecarFrom` keeps it, `variance push` forwards it, and
  tribunal stores it in new `baselines.snapshot` and
  `build_subjects.candidate_snapshot` columns (schema 21, migration
  `0019_baseline-snapshot.sql`) and promotes it on approval. On
  `cases/storybook-case` it adds 3.2–5.4 KB to each sidecar.

  A baseline without a snapshot says so. When a changed verdict has regions and
  its baseline kept no snapshot, or one that will not unpack, the reason ends
  *the baseline records no snapshot of its nodes, so regions were joined against
  this render's boxes alone: an accepting run records one on a revision where
  this subject is unchanged*. An accepting run — `--update-snapshots`, Vitest's
  `--update`, `variance accept` — now re-stamps an unchanged baseline that kept no
  snapshot, as it re-stamps one painted under another identity, and the
  observation marks it `signals.snapshot: 'unrecorded'`; `restamps` in
  `@variance-authority/core/judge` is the one rule all three ask. Every other
  verdict the mark is on ends *the baseline records no snapshot of its nodes, and
  an accepting run records this one*. Two images
  compared directly get the same clause, naming the before image, without the
  remedy, and are never marked.

  A subject whose document has not moved settles on its digest and builds no
  observation to mark, so `settle` now renders a pictured baseline that kept no
  snapshot when this run collected one, with the reason *the baseline records no
  snapshot of its nodes, so this run renders it for an accepting run to record
  one*. A suite of baselines accepted before this release renders them on every
  run until an accepting run re-stamps them. Tribunal records one on ingest
  instead: a pushed candidate's snapshot is written onto a baseline that has an
  image and kept none, when it was painted from the same document under the same
  identity, and never over one it kept, so such a subject renders once. The
  snapshot's runtime fields (`provenance` and its `createdBy`, `wiring`, `holding`,
  `styleProvenance`, `styleTokens`, `ignoredBy`) are then the recording run's: the
  first push, from a build on any branch, that drew that document, as they are the
  accepting run's on a re-stamp. `Described.keepsSnapshot`
  is the new required field it reads:
  the durable, LFS and tribunal stores derive it from the sidecar with
  `keepsSnapshot` from `@variance-authority/core/format`, and the remote store
  refuses a description without it. A packed snapshot now opens with a `v1:`
  header naming its format version, `PACKED_SNAPSHOT_HEADER`, and a snapshot
  without it counts as not kept. `unpackSnapshot` reads one as not recorded
  unless every node in it is one, with `isSemanticSnapshot`, new in
  `@variance-authority/core/format` beside `isRenderDocument` and
  `isSubjectRef`: the checks `@variance-authority/unit-test` already made of a
  capture file's snapshot, document and subject, which it now asks. Tribunal serves API 6, which describes a
  baseline with `keepsSnapshot`; `variance push` against an older deployment names
  the refused descriptions when the project's `remote` baselines are stored there,
  and the remote store's refusal names tribunal before API 6 and a
  `serveRasterStore` from an earlier `@variance-authority/remote`: upgrade the
  server, tribunal or your own, before the client. `settle` takes this run's snapshot as a
  fifth argument. `variance accept` and the MCP changelog call these subjects
  *unchanged and re-stamped* rather than re-stamped under this run's identity,
  which was untrue of them. The render cache no longer hands on a snapshot an
  entry kept.

### Patch Changes

- 8d1bcc1: A link in a doc comment opens from `node_modules`

  Doc comments linked to documentation by repository paths such as
  `../../../../docs/flakiness.md`, which resolve to nothing in an installed
  package. They now link to the page on variance-authority.dev, or to the file on
  GitHub when the site does not publish it, so the link works on hover in your
  editor and in what `variance ask symbol` prints.

  The MCP server's instructions and its observability answer linked to
  `/start-cli` and `/presentation`, which the site does not serve. They now link
  to `/start/cli` and `/docs/presentation`, and the `@variance-authority/cli`,
  `@variance-authority/help`, `@variance-authority/mcp` and
  `@variance-authority/vitest-browser` READMEs link to the guides where the site
  publishes them.

  `variancePrecondition`, `wiringOf`, `tapCommits` and `provenanceOf` carry an
  `@see` link to the section of the guide that documents them.

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- d5cc0c3: A baseline painted under another identity is compared, and the identity is the cause

  There is no `incomparable` verdict: a subject with two images is always
  compared, and reads `unchanged`, `changed`, `new` or `ignored`. When the two
  were painted under different identities, such as another browser version,
  platform, scale factor, font stack or recipe of this tool, the observation
  carries `signals.identity` (`recipe` or `machine`) and `signals.moved`, each
  moved field with both values, and its `because` opens with that cause. A
  `changed` subject fails the gate whatever its cause, and `variance accept --all`,
  Playwright Test's `--update-snapshots` and Vitest's `--update` adopt it like any
  other change. An `unchanged` subject under a moved identity is re-stamped
  under this run's identity by the same three, so an upgrade is named once rather
  than on every later run. A re-stamp approves nothing: `variance accept` counts
  it in `restamped` and its summary, not among the accepted subjects or the
  commit message, and the `variance_changelog` preview says so. A durable store's
  `put` moves a baseline along its line, one engine family on one platform at one
  scale: the line's older copy is removed, so a lookup never compares against a
  superseded image, while a matrix of engines or machines keeps one baseline
  each. A lookup that misses its own identity reads its line first. `variance_explain` names the moved identity as the
  cause of a change, and the tribunal no longer counts or lists an
  `incomparable` verdict. `@variance-authority/raster` exports `identityCause`,
  which says whether two identities differ in the recipe alone or in the machine,
  with its `IdentityCause` and `ComparedSides` types. `variance doctor` reports a
  store painted by another machine as `PAINTED ELSEWHERE` and exits `0`: the run
  compares it. Its `baselines.comparable` field is now `baselines.paintedHere`.
  The pull-request comment groups these
  subjects under "Painted under another identity", one line per identity that
  moved. Its section for subjects with no image to point at is headed "Nothing to
  point at", which was "Not compared".
- 1a0b845: A subject is read with nothing hovered, nothing focused, motion reduced and `Date` fixed

  Every layout and raster baseline made before this release is compared under a
  moved recipe once; a semantic baseline, read in jsdom, does not move. The
  default recipes gained tricks, so the stabilization digest every reading records
  has changed, and each subject names that recipe as the cause of whatever it
  reports. Review the changes and adopt them with `variance accept --all`, as for
  any recipe change.

  The standard collection recipe now also holds:

  - `no-hover`: the pointer is moved to `(-1, -1)`, off the page, once per page
    before it loads. On the `variance` fixture's page it is moved again before
    every observation, a frame each, and not put back: a menu a script opened on
    hover is closed for your test's next step.
  - `no-focus`: whatever holds focus is blurred before the subject is read,
    including an element inside a shadow root. On a page your test or agent goes
    on using, focus goes back to that element once the reading and any screenshot
    of it are taken, so a test types where it left off. The blur still ran the
    page's blur handlers, and what they did, such as a validate-on-blur error,
    stays.
  - `reduced-motion`: the browser reports `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`, which
    stops the script animations of a page that honours it, and the reading
    declares the same preference among the conditions its `@media` rules are
    resolved against. A `prefers-reduced-motion` condition you declare through
    `createHarness`'s `features` wins, and the browser is asked for that value;
    a declared `no-preference` is not recorded as `reduced-motion`. Rules under
    `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)` are not read by default;
    leave `reduced-motion` out to read them.
  - `freeze-clock`: `Date` reads one instant. A script added before the page's
    own replaces `new Date()`, `Date()` and `Date.now()`, and gives the same
    instant to `Intl.DateTimeFormat`'s `format()` and `formatToParts()` called
    without a date. Timers, animation frames and `performance.now()` are the
    browser's own, so a page that settles on a timer still settles. No Playwright
    clock is installed, so `page.clock` stays yours, and a clock your test
    installs replaces the fixed `Date`; the reading still records `freeze-clock`,
    so leave it out of the list when your test owns the clock. `Temporal.Now` and
    `Date` inside a worker are not fixed. The default instant is in the past, and
    the browser's cookie store keeps real time: a cookie your page's script sets
    with an expiry counted from `Date.now()` is already expired and is not
    stored, so a dismissed consent banner can come back after the next
    navigation. Set `varianceNow` or `now` near today, or leave `freeze-clock`
    out.

  The render and layout recipes gain `no-focus` alone, because a painted document
  still honours a collected `autofocus`. The other three have nothing to act on
  there: the date the page printed is already text in the document, and its
  `@media` rules were resolved when it was read. A `<script>` inside a subject
  root is carried into the render document and runs there under the real clock.
  Every document is painted under the render recipe, so a reading taken without
  `no-focus` is still painted blurred.

  The instant defaults to `DEFAULT_NOW`, `2024-06-15T12:00:00.000Z`, exported
  from `@variance-authority/core/format`. `routeCollector` and
  `storybookCollector` take a `now` option to choose another. It must be an ISO
  8601 instant with its zone; anything else is refused before a browser opens.
  An instant other than the default is spelled in the clock's id,
  `freeze-clock@<instant>`, so it is part of the environment key, and a baseline taken at one instant is compared
  with a run at another with the moved instant named as the cause.

  To read a subject hovered, focused, animated or at the real time, pass your own
  `stabilize` list without that trick: `DEFAULT_STABILIZE`, the ids of the
  default recipe, filtered, as in
  `DEFAULT_STABILIZE.filter((id) => id !== 'freeze-clock')`. It is exported from
  `@variance-authority/core/format`, `@variance-authority/route-collector`,
  `@variance-authority/storybook-collector` and
  `@variance-authority/playwright-test`. `storybookCollector` and `observe` in
  `@variance-authority/playwright-test` now take `stabilize`, as `routeCollector`
  already did.

  A trick needs a browser driver to apply it, and is recorded only where one did.
  The collectors apply all four. So does the `variance` fixture in
  `@variance-authority/playwright-test`: it sets `reduced-motion` and
  `freeze-clock` on the `page` it hands your test, before the test body runs, and
  takes the pointer off the page and releases focus before every observation,
  giving focus back after it. Two new fixture options, `varianceStabilize` and
  `varianceNow`, choose what it sets and the instant, and are set with
  `test.use`; `varianceDriven` holds the ids it set. A fixed `Date` stops code
  that times itself with `Date.now()`: a debounce or a throttle, such as lodash's
  `debounce`, sees no time pass and never fires, so a test that types into a
  debounced search box can stop getting results after this upgrade. A loop that
  waits for `Date.now()` to pass a mark hangs the page, an animation timed by
  `Date`, such as jQuery's `animate`, never calls its `complete`, and a client
  that checks a token's `nbf` or `iat` against `Date.now()` can refuse a token
  issued today. None of these failures names the clock. Leave
  `freeze-clock` out for such a test, and for one that sets `page.clock` itself:

  ```ts
  import { DEFAULT_STABILIZE } from '@variance-authority/playwright-test';

  test.use({ varianceStabilize: DEFAULT_STABILIZE.filter((id) => id !== 'freeze-clock') });
  ```

  On a page the fixture never handed your test,
  such as one opened from your own browser context, call the new
  `driveBeforeTest(page)` before `page.goto()` to set the same two; `observe` and
  `createVariance` there apply `no-hover` and `no-focus`.
  `@variance-authority/vitest-browser` reads from inside your page and has no
  driver; `@variance-authority/presentation` reads through the Playwright `Page`
  you hand it, a test's or an agent's live browser, and does not drive it. Both
  apply `no-focus` only, giving focus back once the reading is taken. A trick left out is absent from the
  reading's ids and digest, as a trick a tier cannot reach already is.
  `stabilizeForObservation` in `@variance-authority/dom` takes `driven`, the ids
  your driver applied, and returns `refocus()`, which gives focus back to the
  element the reading released. `stabilizeAsRequested` takes the recipe by id, as
  a page agent receives it. `createHarness` in `@variance-authority/playwright`
  takes a `stabilize` recipe to drive its page before the first navigation, and
  reports the ids it applied as `driven`. `createObservedHarness` opens one with
  `observeNetwork` started before its first navigation, as both collectors do.

  `createPlaywrightRenderer` no longer couples `no-focus` to `waitForFonts`:
  `waitForFonts: false` turns off the waits alone.

  `@variance-authority/core/format` exports `DEFAULT_STABILIZE`, `DEFAULT_NOW`,
  `driveBeforeLoad` and `driveBeforeRead`, which apply the driver tricks to a
  Playwright `Page`, `forDriver`, which drops the ones a host did not apply,
  `featuresOf`, which declares the motion preference a recipe drove, and
  `recipeToDrive`, which resolves a `stabilize` list and checks `now` before a
  browser opens.

### Patch Changes

- 1eed290: A form filled in after mount is painted and compared filled in

  Text a play function or a test typed into an `<input>` or `<textarea>`, the
  option it chose in a `<select>` and the box it ticked now reach the render
  document and the snapshot. Before, the document painted the form as the server
  sent it and the snapshot did not move for typed text or a chosen option. A
  password field's value is carried as one `•` per character, and a file input's
  value is not carried. A form nobody filled in reads exactly as before.

  This is part of `RULESET_VERSION` `r2`. A subject whose form was filled in
  after the server sent it has a new render document, so after this upgrade its
  image shows the form filled in and reads `changed` against a baseline painted
  empty; `variance accept --all` adopts it. A Playwright test painted its form
  filled in before this change, so it does not move there.
- d432339: A page reads its clock in UTC and formats for en-US, not for the host

  The harness the route and Storybook collectors open, and the pages the renderer
  paints, took their timezone and locale from the machine. A date the page
  formatted read one way on a laptop in Sydney and another on a runner in
  Virginia, from one build, and the two compared against one baseline as
  `changed`.

  Both are pinned: `timezoneId` to `UTC` and `locale` to `en-US`. Declare either
  in `variance.config.json` (`"timezoneId": "Europe/Berlin"`, `"locale":
  "de-DE"`) and the collectors and the renderer pin that instead; an unknown
  timezone or a malformed language tag is refused by its field.
  `createHarness` and `createPlaywrightRenderer` take the same two options.
  `@variance-authority/core/format` exports their type, `PageRegion`, and
  `@variance-authority/playwright` exports `pinnedRegion`, which fills in `UTC`
  and `en-US` for a field left out.

  Both are part of the environment key, and the renderer's pair is part of
  `RenderIdentity.rasterization`. A capture read in another timezone or language
  is another environment, and an image painted in one is compared with a
  baseline painted in another, with `rasterization` named as the cause of
  whatever moved.

  `@variance-authority/playwright-test` paints each test in the timezone and
  locale its page runs in: whatever the Playwright project or `test.use` sets.
  When neither sets a `timezoneId`, `varianceFixtures` opens the page in `UTC`
  rather than the host's, so a laptop and a runner in UTC read it under one key;
  Playwright Test already opens it in `en-US` when nothing sets a `locale`. That
  reaches every test of a suite extended with `varianceFixtures`, including tests
  that never call `variance`, so a test that asserts a date formatted in your
  machine's timezone reads it in `UTC` after this upgrade; set `timezoneId` in
  `use` to keep your own. A page
  you hand to `createVariance` is read and painted in whatever its own context
  opened it in, which is the host's timezone when that context set none: open the
  context with `timezoneId: 'UTC'` to match. `varianceRenderer` is now a test fixture, chosen
  by the page, and `varianceRenderers` is the worker's set of renderers, one per
  timezone and locale; a project that overrode `varianceRenderer` at worker scope
  overrides it at test scope instead.

  **Every image painted by the Playwright renderer is compared under a moved
  recipe once after this upgrade**, because its recipe now carries the timezone
  and locale. Each subject names `rasterization` as the cause of what it reports,
  and one whose pixels moved is `changed`:

  - With `variance run`: the run exits `1` for each `changed` subject. Review
    them in `variance report --format html` and adopt them with
    `variance accept --all`. A rerun reports `unchanged`.
  - With `@variance-authority/playwright-test`: the suite fails each `changed`
    test, and `--update-snapshots=changed` adopts them.
  - With `@variance-authority/vitest-browser`: `vitest --update` adopts them, as
    `variance accept --all` does.

  `@variance-authority/vitest-browser` reads no `variance.config.json` and takes no
  timezone or locale, so it paints in `UTC` and `en-US` whatever its tab ran in,
  and neither it nor `@variance-authority/unit-test` writes a timezone or locale
  to the environment key.
- 9bb6f47: A moved identity names only the fields that differ

  When the baseline was painted under another identity, the `because` sentence
  names only the identity fields that differ between the baseline and this run,
  and says whether they are the machine (renderer, engine, platform, scale, fonts)
  or only variance-authority's recipe (the stabilization or rasterization digest).
  `recipeOnly`, exported from `@variance-authority/raster`, answers which.

  An observation from `@variance-authority/observe` carries `signals.document`,
  saying whether the document is the one the baseline was painted from, so a
  recipe change over an unchanged document reads apart from one that moved the
  page too. `signals.pixels` is optional, since a subject that occupies no pixels
  has none to measure; TypeScript code that reads `Observation.signals.pixels`
  must handle it being absent.

  `variance ask summary` prints a reason that several subjects share once, with a
  count, and lists the subjects under it, so an upgrade that moves every subject
  reads as one line rather than one per subject. It groups the same way the
  pull-request comment does, through `byReason`, exported from
  `@variance-authority/report`.
- ef496ad: READMEs name what the program does

  The package READMEs, and the `@variance-authority/vantage` and
  `@variance-authority/playwright-test` descriptions, no longer write a test, a
  record or a run as something that says, asks or knows. Each sentence names what
  the program does: a command prints, a record holds a field, a test runs or
  covers. Where a value is filled in from configuration or a default rather than
  recorded, the README says so. Four renamed headings change their anchors:
  `help`'s "Where the declaration is undocumented", `playwright`'s "Where a
  component is declared, read from the engine", `storybook`'s "What a pass sends
  the preview" and `sense`'s "Correct what a file's text declares it imports".
- 55f1bc9: The Playwright and Vitest integrations keep the render cache out of the baseline directory

  The store the `variance` fixture opens, the store `createVariance` and `observe`
  open, and the store the Vitest plugin opens all paint into `renders/` in the
  checkout's cache, where `variance run` paints. Each one prunes that directory by
  the rules `variance run` applies: the fixture when a worker tears down, a
  `createVariance` session when it closes, once per process, and the Vitest
  plugin when the run closes. The baseline directory holds baselines only, so the
  `.variance/baselines/**/by-document/` line in `.gitignore` and a store built only
  to set `cacheRoot` are no longer needed: delete any `by-document/` directory
  left under your baseline root, since nothing prunes it there. A `store` you pass
  in is unchanged. Finding the cache reads the root `variance.config.json` the
  way `variance run` does, so a file that is not JSON, or a `cacheRoot` that is
  not a path, now fails the fixture and the plugin as it fails the CLI.

  `renderCacheIn(cache)` from `@variance-authority/store/durable` returns the
  `renders` directory inside a cache directory, so a store you build can share
  that cache and its bound. `cacheRootFor` from the new
  `@variance-authority/sense/cache-root` entry finds the checkout's cache without
  loading the rest of Sense. `@variance-authority/vitest-browser` now depends on
  `@variance-authority/sense` for it, which installs Sense's parser and resolver
  with the plugin; the plugin does not load them.
- 754d04c: The port a build is served on is no part of a render

  The route and Storybook collectors serve a build on a free port, and that port
  reached three identities. An asset the page loaded was keyed by its absolute
  URL, a `url()` in a computed style was the absolute URL the engine resolved,
  and the document digest read both. One build served twice therefore read as two
  environment keys and two documents: each run missed the render cache, painted
  again, and read its document as changed against its own baseline.

  An asset the page's own origin serves is keyed by its path, and the page's
  origin is dropped from a `url()` before it is hashed. An asset another origin
  serves keeps its absolute URL. A capture carries the page's `baseUrl` so core
  knows which origin is the page's, and the renderer resolves a path-keyed asset
  against the document's `baseUrl`. `documentDigest` reads the page's own base
  and resources as paths, so one build served on two ports addresses one render
  and the render cache hits; the document keeps them absolute for the renderer,
  and a resource another origin serves stays absolute in the digest too.

  A `@variance-authority/unit-test` capture keys its assets the same way, so a
  `@variance-authority/vitest-browser` observation, which captures through it on
  the port the runner had free, keeps the port out of its environment key.
  `readCapture` reads back a capture whose asset is keyed by path, resolving the
  key against the document's `baseUrl` as the renderer does; `assetUrl` in
  `@variance-authority/core/format` is that one resolution.

  **The document of every page served over `http` moves once after this
  upgrade.** `documentDigest` now reads a document's base and resources without
  the page's origin, so the digest of every document served over `http` or
  `https` changes: every route, every story, every Vitest browser page, and every
  Playwright page opened by URL. A moved document misses the render cache once,
  and its image is still compared with the baseline: a page whose pixels did not
  move reads `unchanged`, and one whose pixels did reads `changed`, which
  `variance accept --all` and Playwright's `--update-snapshots=changed` adopt.
  `RULESET_VERSION` moves from `r1` to `r2`. The ruleset is part of a snapshot's
  environment key, not of the render recipe, so no image names it as a moved
  identity; a snapshot diffed against one recorded under `r1` names the ruleset as its
  environment root.

### Minor Changes

- 740f2af: The tab reads, and the run judges

  A Vitest browser-mode test has already done the expensive half of a visual
  observation. It mounted the component in a real engine with the real
  stylesheets, and the locator it awaited is the evidence the thing arrived. What
  it cannot do is judge: the baseline is on a disk the tab cannot reach, and
  painting a document is a browser the tab cannot launch.

  `@variance-authority/vitest-browser` is those two halves either side of Vitest's
  command protocol. In the tab, `variance(subject)` settles the subject's Suspense
  boundaries, holds animation still, and reads the mount once — markup, applicable
  CSS, component provenance, framework wiring, and the bytes of every resource it
  references, fetched with the page's own `fetch`. In the Vitest process,
  `variancePlugin()` registers the command, holds one renderer and one store open
  for the run, paints the captured document, and answers with the verdict and the
  sentence a failing assertion prints.

  The document is painted rather than screenshotted, with the tab's own browser
  sitting right there. A live screenshot carries no render identity — nothing that
  can say which machine, which scale, which font stack — so a baseline made from
  one is reproducible on no other machine, starting with the CI runner that judges
  it next.

  Media queries resolve against the tester iframe rather than the browser tab,
  because that is the frame the subject was laid out in.

  `@variance-authority/unit-test` publishes `capture` on its own entrypoint,
  `@variance-authority/unit-test/capture`, carrying nothing that touches a
  filesystem. Resource bytes are encoded without `Buffer`, which the subject's own
  realm does not always have; in a browser tab the previous spelling threw while
  closing the first resource a fixture referenced, and arrived as a capture that
  could not see images rather than as a missing global.
